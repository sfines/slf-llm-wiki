## Abstract

Efficiency techniques are an integral part of Entity Resolution, since its infancy. In this survey, we organized the bulk of works in the field into Blocking, Filtering and hybrid techniques, facilitating their understanding and use. We also provided an in-dept coverage of each category, further classifying the corresponding works into novel sub-categories. Lately, the efficiency techniques have received more attention, due to the rise of Big Data. This includes large volumes of semi-structured data, which pose challenges not only to the scalability of efficiency techniques, but also to their core assumptions: the requirement of Blocking for schema knowledge and of Filtering for high similarity thresholds. The former led to the introduction of schema-agnostic Blocking in conjunction with Block Processing techniques, while the latter led to more relaxed criteria of similarity. Our survey covers these new fields in detail, putting in context all relevant works.

Entity Resolution (ER), a core task of Data Integration, detects different entity profiles that correspond to
the same real-world object. Due to its inherently quadratic complexity, a series of techniques accelerate it
so that it scales to voluminous data. In this survey, we review a large number of relevant works under two
different but related frameworks: Blocking and Filtering. The former restricts comparisons to entity pairs that
are more likely to match, while the latter identifies quickly entity pairs that are likely to satisfy predetermined
similarity thresholds. We also elaborate on hybrid approaches that combine different characteristics. For each
framework we provide a comprehensive list of the relevant works, discussing them in the greater context. We
conclude with the most promising directions for future work in the field.

1 INTRODUCTION
Entity Resolution (ER) is the task of identifying different entity profiles that describe the same
real-world object [29, 48]. It is a core task for Data Integration, applying to any kind of data, from
the structured entities of relational databases [24] to the semi-structured entities of the Linked Open
Data Cloud (https://lod-cloud.net) [29, 39] and the unstructured entities that are automatically
extracted from free text [152]. ER consists of two parts: (i) the candidate selection step, which
determines the entities worth comparing, and (ii) the candidate matching step, or simply Matching,
which compares the selected entities to determine whether they represent the same real-world
object. The latter step involves pairwise comparisons, i.e., time-consuming operations that typically
apply string similarity measures to pairs of entities, dominating the overall cost of ER [24, 29, 39].
In this survey, we focus on the candidate selection step, which is the crucial part of ER with
respect to time efficiency and scalability. Without it, ER suffers from a quadratic time complexity,
O(n2), as every entity profile has to be compared with all others. Reducing this computational
cost is the goal of numerous techniques from two dominant frameworks: Blocking and Filtering.
The former attempts to identify entity pairs that are likely to match, restricting comparisons
only between them, while the latter attempts to quickly discard pairs that are guaranteed to not

match, executing comparisons only between the rest. The former operates without knowledge
of the Matching step, while the latter is based on it, assuming that two entities match if their
similarity exceeds a specified threshold. Hence, Blocking and Filtering share the same goal, but
are complementary, as they operate under different settings and assumptions. So far, though, they
have been developed independently of one another: their combination and, more generally, their
relation have been overlooked in the literature, with the exception of very few works (e.g., [86]).
Moreover, the rise of Big Data poses new challenges for both Blocking and Filtering approaches
[29, 39]: Volume requires techniques to scale to millions of entities, while Variety calls for techniques
that can cope with an unprecedented schema heterogeneity. Both Blocking and Filtering address
Volume primarily through paralellization. Existing techniques were adapted to split their workload
into smaller chunks that are distributed across different processing units so that they are executed
in parallel. This can be done on a cluster (distributed methods), or through the modern multi-core
and multi-socket hardware architectures. Variety, though, is addressed differently in each field. For
Blocking, the schema-aware methods are replaced by schema-agnostic techniques, which disregard
any schema information, creating blocks of very high recall but low precision. Additionally, a whole
new category of methods, called Block Processing, intervenes between Blocking and Matching to
refine the original blocks, significantly increasing precision at a negligible (if any) cost in recall. For
Filtering, techniques that employ more relaxed matching criteria (e.g., fuzzy set matching or local
string similarity join) are proposed, while the case of low similarity thresholds is also considered.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey to comprehensively cover the aforemen-
tioned aspects and to jointly review the two frameworks for efficient ER. We formally define
Blocking, Block Processing and Filtering, introducing a common terminology that facilitates their
understanding. For each field, we propose a new taxonomy with categories that highlight the dis-
tinguishing characteristics of the corresponding methods. Based on these taxonomies, we provide
a broad overview of every field, elucidating the functionality of the main techniques as well as
the relations among them. As a result, established techniques are now seen in a different light -
Canopy Clustering [101], for instance, may now be viewed as a Block Processing method. We also
elaborate on the parallelization methods for each field. Most importantly, this survey attempts to
place Blocking and Filtering under a common context, taking special care to stress hybrid methods
that combine features from both Blocking and Filtering, to analyze works that experimentally
compare the two frameworks (e.g., [158]) and to qualitatively outline their commonalities and
differences. We also investigate the ER tools that incorporate established efficiency techniques and
propose a series of open challenges that constitute promising directions for future research.

Parts of the material included in this survey have been presented in tutorials at WWW 2014 [161],
ICDE 2016 [127], ICDE 2017 [160], and WWW 2018 [128]. A past survey [25] also covers efficiency
ER techniques, but is restricted to the schema-aware Blocking methods. Other surveys [48] and
textbooks [24, 29, 39] provide a holistic overview of ER, merely examining the main Blocking
and Block Processing techniques. Closer to our work is a recent survey on Blocking [115], which
however offers a more limited coverage and refers neither to parallelization nor to Filtering works.
Recent surveys on string and set similarity joins also exist, but they focus exclusively on centralized
[68, 99, 191] or distributed approaches [51], with the purpose of experimental comparison, and
without covering approximate techniques that allow for more relaxed matching criteria. Most
importantly, none of these surveys considers similarity joins in the broader context of ER.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background knowledge on ER
and its efficiency techniques, while Sections 3 and 4 delve into Blocking and Block Processing,
respectively. Section 5 is devoted to Filtering, whereas Section 6 elaborates on works that combine
Blocking with Filtering. Section 8 enumerates the main ER tools that incorporate efficiency methods,

Section 7 provides a high-level discussion of the relation between Blocking and Filtering, Section 9
provides the main directions for future work, and Section 10 concludes the paper.

2 PRELIMINARIES
At the core of ER lies the notion of entity profile, which constitutes a uniquely identified description
of a real-world object in the form of name-value pairs. Assuming infinite sets of attribute names N ,
attribute values V, and unique identifiers I, an entity profile is formally defined as follows [29, 124]:

Definition 1 (Entity Profile). An entity profile eid is a tuple ⟨id, Aid ⟩, where id ∈ I is a unique
identifier, and Aid is a set of name-value pairs ⟨n, v⟩, with n ∈ N and v ∈ (V ∪ I). A set of entity
profiles E is called entity collection.

This definition is simple, but flexible enough to accommodate a wide variety of (semi-)structured
representations. E.g., nested attributes can be transformed into a flat set of name-value pairs, while
links may be represented by assigning the id of one entity as the attribute value of the other.

Definition 2 (Entity Resolution). Two entity profiles ei and ej match, ei ≡ ej, if they refer to
the same real-world entity. Matching entities are also called duplicates. The task of Entity Resolution
(ER) is to find all matching entities within an entity collection or across two or more entity collections.

In particular, we distinguish between the following two cases [24, 25]:
(1) Deduplication receives as input an entity collection E and produces as output the set of all
pairs of matching entity profiles within E, i.e., D(E) = {(ei , ej ) : ei ∈ E, ej ∈ E, ei ≡ ej }.
(2) Record Linkage receives two duplicate-free entity collections, E1 and E2, and returns the pairs
of matching entity profiles between them, i.e., D(E1, E2)={(ei , ej ) : ei ∈ E1, ej ∈ E2, ei ≡ ej }.
Multi-source Entity Resolution involves three or more entity collections and can be performed
by applying Deduplication to the union of all collections, or by executing a sequence of pairwise
Record Linkage tasks, provided that every input collection is duplicate-free.

ER performance is characterized by its effectiveness and its efficiency. The former refers to how
many of the actual duplicates are detected, while the latter expresses the computational cost for
detecting them – usually in terms of the number of performed comparisons, which is referred to as
cardinality and denoted by ||E ||. The naive, brute-force approach performs all pairwise comparisons
between the input entity profiles, having a quadratic complexity that does not scale to large datasets;
for Record Linkage, ||E || = |E1| × |E2|, while for Deduplication ||E || = |E | · (|E | − 1)/2.

Blocking. To tackle ER’s inherently quadratic complexity, Blocking trades slightly lower ef-
fectiveness for significantly higher efficiency. Its goal is to reduce the number of performed com-
parisons, while missing as few matches as possible. Ideally, one would compare only the pairs of
duplicates, whose number grows linearly with the number of the input entity profiles [54, 160].
To this end, Blocking clusters potentially matching entities in common blocks and exclusively
compares entity profiles that co-occur in at least one block.

Internally, a blocking method employs a blocking scheme, which applies to one or more entity
collections to yield a set of blocks B, called block collection. Cardinality ||B|| denotes the num-
ber of comparisons in B, given that only entity pairs within the same block are compared, i.e.,
||B||=(cid:205)
bi ∈B ||bi ||, where ||bi || stands for the number of comparisons contained in an individual
block bi . We denote the set of detectable duplicates in B as D(B), while D(E) stands for all existing
duplicates. Since B reduces the number of performed comparisons, D(B)⊆D(E).

A common assumption in the literature is the oracle, i.e., a perfect matching function that, for
each pair of entity profiles, decides correctly whether they match or not [25, 39, 124, 125, 160]. Using
an oracle, a pair of duplicates is detected as long as they share at least one block. This allows for

reasoning about the performance of blocking methods independently of matching methods: there
is a clear trade-off between the effectiveness and the efficiency of a blocking scheme [25, 39, 160]:
the more comparisons are contained in the resulting block collection B (i.e., higher ||B||), the more
duplicates will be detected (i.e., higher |D(B)|), raising effectiveness at the cost of lower efficiency.
Thus, a blocking scheme should achieve a good balance between these two competing objectives as
expressed through the following measures [16, 34, 104, 120]:

(1) Pair Completeness (PC) corresponds to recall, estimating the portion of the detectable dupli-

cates in B with respect to those in E: PC(B) = |D(B)|/|D(E)| ∈ [0, 1].

(2) Pairs Quality (PQ) corresponds to precision, estimating the portion of comparisons in B that

correspond to real duplicates: PQ(B) = |D(B)|/||B|| ∈ [0, 1].

(3) Reduction Ratio (RR) measures the reduction in the number of pairwise comparisons in B

with respect to the brute-force approach: RR(B, E) = 1 − ||B||/||E || ∈ [0, 1]..

Higher values for PC indicate higher effectiveness of the blocking scheme, while higher values
for PQ and RR indicate higher efficiency. Note that PC provides an optimistic estimation of recall,
presuming the existence of an oracle, while PQ provides a pessimistic estimation of precision,
treating as false positives the repeated comparisons between duplicates (i.e., only the non-repeated
duplicate pairs are considered as true positives). In this context, we can define Blocking as follows:

Definition 3 (Blocking). Given an entity collection E, Blocking clusters similar entities into a

block collection B such that PC(B), PQ(B) and RR(B, E) are simultaneously maximized.

This definition refers to Deduplication, but can be easily extended to Record Linkage. Simultane-
ously maximizing PC, PQ and RR necessitates that the enhancements in efficiency do not affect
the effectiveness of Blocking, carefully removing comparisons between non-matching entities.
Conceptually, Blocking can be viewed as an optimization task, but this implies that the real duplicate
collection D(E) is known, which is actually what ER tries to compute. Hence, Blocking is typically
treated as an engineering task that provides an approximate solution for the data at hand.

A blocking-based ER workflow may comprise several stages. First, Block Building (BlBu) applies
a blocking scheme to produce a block collection B from the input entity collection(s). This step
may be repeated several times on the same input, applying multiple blocking schemes, in order to
achieve a more robust performance in the context of highly noisy data. Often, there is a second,
optional stage, called Block Processing, which refines B through additional optimizations that
further reduce the number of performed comparisons. This may involve discarding entire blocks
that primarily contain unnecessary comparisons, called Block Cleaning (BlCl), and/or discarding
individual comparisons within certain blocks, called Comparison Cleaning (CoCl). The former may

be applied repeatedly, each time enforcing a different, complementary method to discard blocks,
but the latter can be performed only once; CoCl comprises competitive methods that serve exactly
the same purpose and, once applied to a block collection, they alter it in such a way that turns all
other methods inapplicable. Figure 1(a) models this workflow as a deterministic finite automaton
with three states, where each state corresponds to one of the blocking sub-tasks.

Filtering. Given two entity collections E1 and E2, a similarity function fS : E1 × E2 → IR, and a
similarity threshold θ , a similarity join identifies all pairs of entity profiles in E1 and E2 that have
similarity at least θ , i.e., E1 (cid:49)θ E2 = {(ei , ej ) ∈ E1 × E2 : fS (ei , ej ) ≥ θ }.

Similarity joins can be used for defining ER under the intuitive assumption that matching entity
profiles are highly similar. In fact, the above formulation corresponds to Record Linkage, while
Deduplication can be defined analogously as a self-join operation, where E1 ≡ E2.

To avoid exhaustive pairwise comparisons, similarity joins typically follow the filter-verification

framework, which involves two stages [10, 68]:

(1) Filtering computes a set of candidates for each entity ei , excluding all those that cannot match

with ei . In other words, it prunes all true negatives, but allows some false positives.

(2) Verification computes the actual similarity between candidates (or a sufficient upper bound)

to remove the false positives.

Due to the relatively straightforward implementation of Verification, in the following we exclu-
sively focus on Filtering. The relevant techniques are defined with respect to three parameters:
(i) the representation for each entity, (ii) the similarity function between entity pairs under this
representation, and (iii) the similarity threshold above which two entities are considered to match.
The representation typically relies on signatures extracted from each entity such that two entities
match only if their signatures overlap. Given that we address ER over entities described by one
or more textual attributes, we focus on string similarity joins, which can be character- or token-
based. The former compare two strings by representing them as sequences of characters and by
considering the character transformations required to transform one string into the other. The
latter are also called set similarity joins, since they transform the strings into sets, typically via
tokenization or q-gram extraction, and then compare strings using a set-based similarity measure.
Regarding the similarity function, the most common one for character-based similarity joins is
Edit Distance, which measures the minimum number of edit operations (i.e., insertions, deletions
and substitutions) that are required to transform one string to the other [10]. For token-based
similarity joins, the most commonly used similarity measures include Overlap, Jaccard, Cosine or
Dice. The last three are normalized variants of the Overlap [10, 68, 99].

Finally, the similarity threshold depends on the data at hand. Note, though, that the join algorithms
do not operate directly with thresholds on Jaccard, Cosine or Dice similarity, but first translate the
given threshold θ into an equivalent set overlap threshold τ that depends on the size of the sets, as
shown in Figure 2. A similar transformation is also possible for Edit Distance, which means that
set similarity joins may be applied to this measure as well [10].

Blocking vs Filtering. The relation between the two frameworks is illustrated in Figure 1(b).
Blocking, in the sense of the entire process in Figure 1(a), is applied first, reducing the pairwise
comparisons that are considered by Matching. These comparisons are further cut down by Filtering,
which is subsequently applied, as the initial part of Matching, given that it requires specifying both
a similarity measure and a similarity threshold. Next, Verification is applied to estimate the actual
similarity between the compared attribute values. The Entity Resolution process concludes with
Match Decision, which synthesizes the estimated similarity between multiple attribute values to
determine whether the compared entity profiles are indeed duplicates.

Both Blocking and Filtering are optional steps, but at least one of them should be applied in order
to tame the otherwise quadratic computational cost of ER. As shown in Figure 1(c), Blocking yields
a super-linear, but sub-quadratic time complexity, lying between the two extremes: the brute-force
solution and the ideal one (i.e., Duplicate Pairs). The same applies to the computational cost of
Filtering, except that it typically constitutes an exact procedure that produces no false negatives, i.e.,
missed duplicates. It exclusively allows false positives, which are later removed by Verification [10].
For this reason, Filtering corresponds to a superset of Duplicate Pairs in Figure 1(c). In contrast,
Blocking constitutes an inherently approximate solution that increases ER efficiency at the cost
of allowing both false positives and false negatives [29]. Thus, it intersects Duplicate Pairs, such
that the area of their intersection is inversely proportional to the duplicates that are missed by
Blocking, while the relative complement of the Duplicate Pairs in Blocking is analogous to the
executed comparisons between non-matching entities.

Note that Figure 1(c) corresponds to Deduplication, but can be easily generalized to Record
Linkage, as well. Moreover, the relative performance of Blocking and Filtering, i.e., the relative
position of their circles, depends on the methods and the data at hand. In most cases, though, the
best solution is to use both frameworks, yielding the computational cost that corresponds to their
intersection. However, this approach is rarely used in the literature (e.g., [86]). Most works on
Blocking typically omit Filtering (e.g., [25, 116, 132]), whereas most works on Filtering disregard
Blocking, applying directly to the input entity collections (e.g., [68, 99]). The goal of the present
survey is to cover this gap, elucidating the complementarity of the two frameworks.

3 BLOCK BUILDING
Block Building receives as input one or more entity collections and produces as output a block
collection B. The process is guided by a blocking scheme, which determines how entity profiles
are assigned to blocks. This scheme typically comprises two parts. First, every entity is processed
to extract signatures (e.g., tokens), such that the similarity of signatures reflects the similarity of
the corresponding profiles. Second, every entity is mapped to one or more blocks based on these
signatures. Let P(S) denote the power set of a set S and K denote the universe of signatures
appearing in entity profiles. We formally define a blocking scheme as follows:

Definition 4 (Blocking Scheme). Given an entity collection E, a blocking scheme is a function
fB : E → P(B) that maps entity profiles to blocks. It is composed of two functions: (a) a transformation
function fT : E → P(K) that maps an entity profile to a set of signatures (also called blocking keys),
and (b) an assignment function fA : K → P(B) that maps each signature to one or more blocks.
This definition applies to Deduplication, but can be easily extended to Record Linkage.
The set of comparisons in the resulting block collection B is called comparison collection and is
denoted by C(B). Every comparison ci, j ∈ C(B) belongs to one of the following types [124, 125]:

• Matching comparison, if ei and ej match.
• Superfluous comparison, if ei and ej do not match.
• Redundant comparison, if ei and ej have already been compared in a previous block.

We collectively call the last two types unnecessary comparisons, as their execution brings no gain.
Note that the resulting block collection B can be modelled as an inverted index that points from

block ids to entity ids. For this reason, Block Building is also called Indexing [24, 25].

3.1 Taxonomy
To facilitate the understanding of the main methods for Block Building, we organize them into a
novel taxonomy that consists of the following dimensions:

• Key selection distinguishes between non-learning and learning-based methods. The former
rely on rules derived from expert knowledge or mere heuristics, while the latter require a
training set to learn the best blocking keys using Machine Learning techniques.

• Schema-awareness distinguishes between schema-aware and schema-agnostic methods. The
former extract blocking keys from specific attributes that are considered to be more appro-
priate for matching (e.g., more distinctive or less noisy), while the latter disregard schema
knowledge, extracting blocking keys from all attributes.

• Key type distinguishes between hash- or equality-based methods, which map a pair of entities
to the same block if they have a common key, and sort- or similarity-based methods, which
map a pair of entities to the same block if they have a similar key. There exist also hybrid
methods, which combine hash- with sort-based functionality.

• Redundancy-awareness classifies methods into three categories based on the relation between
their blocks. Redundancy-free methods assign every entity to a single block, thus creating

disjoint blocks. Redundancy-positive methods place every entity into multiple blocks, yielding
overlapping blocks. The more blocks two entities share, the more similar their profiles are. The
number of blocks shared by a pair of entities is thus proportional to their matching likelihood.
Redundancy-neutral methods create overlapping blocks, where most entity pairs share the
same number of blocks, or the degree of redundancy is arbitrary, having no implications.
• Constraint-awareness distinguishes blocking methods into lazy, which impose no constraints
on the blocks they create, and proactive, which enforce constraints on their blocks (e.g.,
maximum block size), or refine their comparisons by discarding unnecessary ones.

• Matching-awareness distinguishes between static methods, which are independent of the
subsequent matching process, producing an immutable block collection, and dynamic meth-
ods, which intertwine Block Building with Matching, updating or processing their blocks
dynamically, as more duplicates are detected.

Table 1 maps all methods discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 to our taxonomy.

3.2 Schema-aware Block Building
Methods of this type assume that the input entity profiles adhere to a known schema and, based
on this schema and respective domain knowledge, one can select the attributes that are most
suitable for Blocking. We distinguish between non-learning methods, reviewed in Section 3.2.1,
and learning-based methods, reviewed in Section 3.2.2.

3.2.1 Non-learning Methods. The family tree of the methods in this category is shown in Figure
3(a); a parent-child edge implies that the latter method improves upon the former one. Below, we
elaborate on these methods based on their key type.

Hash-based Methods. Standard Blocking (SB) [50] involves the simplest functionality: an
expert selects the most suitable attributes, and a transformation function concatenates (parts
of) their values to form blocking keys. For every distinct key, a block is created containing all
corresponding entities. In short, SB operates as a hash function, conveying two main advantages: (i)
it yields redundancy-free blocks, and (ii) it has a linear time complexity, O(|E|). On the flip side, its
effectiveness is very sensitive to noise, as the slightest difference in the blocking keys of duplicates
places them in different blocks. SB is also a lazy method that imposes no limit on block sizes.

To address these issues, Suffix Arrays Blocking (SA) [3] converts each blocking key of SB into
the list of its suffixes that are longer than a predetermined minimum length lmin. Then, it defines
a block for every suffix that does not exceed a predetermined frequency threshold bmax , which
essentially specifies the maximum block size. This proactive functionality is necessary, as very
frequent suffixes (e.g., “ing") result in large blocks that are dominated by unnecessary comparisons.

SA has two major advantages [34]: (i) it has low time complexity, O(|E|·loд|E|) [4], and is very
efficient, as it results in a small but relevant set of candidate matches; (ii) it is very effective, due to
the robustness to the noise at the beginning of blocking keys and the high levels of redundancy (i.e.,
it places every entity into multiple blocks). On the downside, SA does not handle noise at the end
of SB keys. E.g., two matches with SB keys “JohnSnith" and “JohnSmith" have no common suffix if
lmin=4, while for lmin=3, they co-occur in a block only if the frequency of “ith" is lower than bmax .
This problem is addressed by Extended Suffix Arrays Blocking [25, 116], which uses as keys not
just the suffixes of SB keys, but all their substrings with more than lmin characters. E.g., for lmin=4,
SA extracts from “JohnSnith" the keys “JohnSnith", “ohnSnith", “hnSnith", “nSnith", “Snith" and
“nith", while Extended SA additionally extracts the keys “John", “ohnS", “hnSn", “nSni", “Snit" as well
as all substrings of “JohnSnith" ranging from 5 to 8 characters.

Another extension of SB is Q-grams Blocking [25, 116]. Its transformation function converts the
blocking keys of SB into sub-sequences of q characters (q-grams) and defines a block for every
distinct q-gram. For example, for q=3, the key france is transformed into the trigrams fra, ran, anc,
nce. This approach differs from Extended SA in that it does not restrict block sizes (lazy method).
Also, it is more resilient to noise than SB, but results in more and larger blocks.

To improve it, Extended Q-Grams Blocking [11, 25, 116] uses combinations of q-grams, instead
of individual q-grams. Its transformation function concatenates at least l q-grams, where l =
max(1, ⌊k · t⌋), with k denoting the number of q-grams and t ∈ [0, 1) standing for a user-defined
threshold. The larger t is, the larger l gets, yielding less keys from the k q-grams. For T = 0.9 and
q=3, the key france is transformed into the following four signatures (k=4 and l=3): [fra, ran, anc,
nce], [fra, ran, anc], [fra, anc, nce], [ran, anc, nce]. In this way, q-gram-based blocking keys become
more distinctive, decreasing the number and cardinality of blocks.

A more advanced q-gram-based approach is MFIBlocks [79]. Its transformation function concate-
nates keys of Q-Grams Blocking into itemsets and uses a maximal frequent itemset algorithm to
define as new blocking keys those exceeding a predetermined support threshold.

Sort-based Methods. Sorted Neighborhood (SN) [64] sorts all blocking keys in alphabetical order
and arranges the associated entities accordingly. Subsequently, a window of fixed size w slides over
the sorted list of entities and compares the entity at the last position with all other entities placed
within the same window. The underlying assumption is that the closer the blocking keys of two
entities are in the lexicographical order, the more likely they are to be matching. Originally crafted
for relational data, SN is extended to hierarchical/XML data based on user-defined keys in [136].
SN has three major advantages [25]: (i) it has low time complexity, O(|E| · loд|E|), (ii) it results
in linear ER complexity, O(w · |E|), and (iii) it is robust to noise, supporting errors at the end of
blocking keys. However, it may place two entities in the same block even if their keys are dissimilar
(e.g., "alphabet" and "apple", if no other key intervenes between them). Its performance also depends
heavily on the window size w, which is difficult to configure, especially in Deduplication, where
the matching entities form clusters of varying size [25, 41].

To ameliorate the effect of w, a common solution is the Multi-pass SN [65], which applies the
core algorithm multiple times, using a different transformation function in each iteration. In this
way, more matches can be identified, even if the window is set to low size. Another solution is the
Extended Sorted Neighborhood [25, 116], which slides a window of fixed size over the sorted list of
blocking keys rather than the list of entities; this means that each block merges w SB blocks.

More advanced strategies adapt the window size dynamically to optimize the balance between
effectiveness and efficiency. They are grouped into three categories, depending on the criterion for
moving the boundaries of the window [95]:

1) Key similarity strategy. The window size increases if the similarity of the blocking keys exceeds

a predetermined threshold, which indicates that more similar entities should be expected [95].

10

G. Papadakis et al.

2) Entity similarity strategy. The window size relies on the similarity of the entities within the
current window. Incrementally Adaptive SN [189] increases the window size if the distance of the
first and the last element in the window is smaller than a predetermined threshold. The actual
increase depends on the current window size and the selected threshold. Accumulative Adaptive SN
[189] creates windows with a single overlapping entity and exploits transitivity to group multiple
adjacent windows into the same block, as long as the last entity of one window is a potential
duplicate of the last entity in the next window. After expanding the window, both algorithms apply
a retrenchment phase that decreases the window size until all entities are potential duplicates.

3) Dynamic strategy. The core assumption is that the more duplicates are found within a window,
the more are expected to be found by increasing its size. Duplicate Count Strategy (DCS) [42] defines
a window w for every entity in SN’s sorted list and executes all its comparisons to compute the
ratio d/c, where d denotes the newly detected duplicates and c the executed comparisons. The
window size is then incremented by one position at a time as long as d/c ≥ ϕ, where ϕ ∈ (0, 1) is a
threshold that expresses the average number of duplicates per comparison. DCS++ [42] improves
DCS by increasing the window size with the next w − 1 entities, even if the new ratio becomes
lower than ϕ. Using transitive closure, it skips some windows, saving part of the comparisons.

Hybrid methods. Sorted Blocks [41] combines the benefits of SB and SN. First, it sorts all
blocking keys and the corresponding entities in lexicographical order, like SN. Then, it partitions
the sorted entities into disjoint blocks, like SB, using a prefix of the blocking keys. Next, all pairwise
comparisons are executed within each block. To avoid missing any matches, an overlap parameter
o defines a window of fixed size that includes the o last entities in the current block together with
the first entity of the next block. The window slides by one position at a time until reaching the oth
entity of the next block, executing all pairwise comparisons between entities from different blocks.
Sorted Blocks is a lazy approach that does not restrict block sizes. Thus, it may result in large
blocks that dominate its processing time. To address this, two proactive variants set a limit on the
maximum block size. Sorted Blocks New Partition [41] creates a new block when the maximum size
is reached for a (prefix of) blocking key; the overlap between the blocks ensures that every entity
is compared with its predecessors and successors in the sorting order. Sorted Blocks Sliding Window
[41] avoids executing all comparisons within a block that is larger than the upper limit; instead, it
slides a window equal to the maximum block size over the entities of the current block.

Finally, Improved Suffix Arrays Blocking [34] employs the same blocking keys as SA, but sorts
them in alphabetical order, like SN. Then, it compares the consecutive keys with a string similarity
measure. If the similarity of two suffixes exceeds a predetermined threshold, the corresponding
blocks are merged in an effort to detect duplicates even when there is noise at the end of SB keys, or
their sole common key is too frequent. For example, Improved SA detects the high string similarity
of the keys “JohnSnith" and “JohnSmith", placing the corresponding entities into the same block.

3.2.2 Learning-based Methods. We distinguish these methods into supervised and unsupervised
ones. Both rely on a labelled dataset that includes pairs of matching and non-matching entities, called
positive and negative instances, respectively. This dataset is used to learn blocking predicates, i.e.,
combinations of an attribute name and a transformation function (e.g., {title, First3Characters}).
Entities sharing the same output for a particular blocking predicate are considered candidate
matches (i.e., hash-based functionality). Disjunctions of conjunctions of predicates, i.e., composite
blocking schemes, are learned by optimizing an objective function.

Supervised Methods. ApproxRBSetCover [16] learns disjunctive blocking schemes by solving a
standard weighted set cover problem. The cover is iteratively constructed by adding in each turn
the blocking predicate that maximizes the ratio of the previously uncovered positive pairs over the
covered negative pairs. This is a "soft cover", since some positive instances may remain uncovered.

11

ApproxDNF [16] alters ApproxRBSetCover so that it learns blocking schemes in Disjunctive
Normal Form (DNF). Instead of individual predicates, each turn greedily learns a conjunction of up
to k predicates that maximizes the ratio of positive and negative covered instances.

A similar approach is Blocking Scheme Learner (BSL) [104]. Based on an adaptation of the
Sequential Covering Algorithm, it learns blocking schemes that maximize RR, while maintaining PC
above a predetermined threshold. Its output is a disjunction of conjunctions of blocking predicates.
BSL is improved by Conjunction Learner [21], which minimizes the candidate matches not only in
the labelled, but also in the unlabelled data, while maintaining high PC. The effect of the unlabelled
data is determined through a weight w ∈ [0, 1]; w = 0 disregards unlabelled data completely, falling
back to BSL, while w = 1 indicates that they are equally important as the labelled ones.

On another line of research, Blocking based on Genetic Programming (BGP) [49] employs a tree
representation of supervised blocking schemes, where every leaf node corresponds to a blocking
predicate. In every turn, a set of genetic programming operators, such as copy, mutation and
crossover, are applied to the initial, random set of blocking schemes. Then, a fitness function infers
the performance of the new schemes from the harmonic mean of PC and RR, and the best ones are
returned as output. Yet, BGP involves numerous internal parameters that are hard to fine-tune.

Another tree-based approach is CBLOCK [150]. In this case, every edge is annotated with a
hash (i.e., transformation) function and every node ni comprises the set of entities that result after
applying all hash functions from the root to ni . CBLOCK is the only proactive learning-based
method, restricting the maximum size of its blocks. Every node that exceeds this limit is split into
smaller, disjoint blocks through a greedy algorithm that picks the best hash function based on the
resulting PC. To minimize the human effort, a drill down approach is proposed for bootstrapping.
Unsupervised Methods. FisherDisjunctive [76] uses a weak training set generated by the TF-
IDF similarity between pairs of entities. Pairs with very low (high) values are considered as negative
(positive) instances. A boolean feature vector is then associated with every labelled instance. The
discovery of DNF blocking schemes is finally cast as a Fisher feature selection problem.

Similarly, DNF Learner [55] applies a matching algorithm to a sample of entity pairs to au-
tomatically create a labelled dataset. Then, the learning of blocking schemes is cast as a DNF
learning problem. To scale it to the exponential search space of possible schemes, their complexity
is restricted to manageable levels (e.g., they comprise at most k predicates).

3.3 Schema-agnostic Block Building
Methods of this type make no assumptions about schema knowledge, disregarding completely
attribute names; they extract blocks from all attribute values. Thus, they inherently support noise
in both attribute names and values and are suitable for highly heterogeneous, loosely structured
entity profiles, such as those stemming from the Web of Data [120, 123, 124].

Non-learning Methods. The family tree of this category appears in Figure 3(b). The cornerstone
approach is Token Blocking (TB) [120]. Assuming that duplicates share at least one common token,
its transformation function extracts all tokens from all attribute values of every entity. A block bt is
then defined for every distinct token t. Hence, two entities co-occur in block bt if they share token
t in their values, regardless of the associated attribute names.

To improve TB, Attribute Clustering Blocking [124] requires the common tokens of two entities
to appear in syntactically similar attributes. These are attribute names that correspond to similar
values, but are not necessarily semantically matching (unlike Schema Matching). First, it clusters
attributes based on the similarities of their aggregate values. Each attribute is connected to its most
similar one and the transitive closure of the connected attributes forms disjoint clusters. A block
bk,t is then defined for every token t in the values of the attributes belonging to cluster k.

12

G. Papadakis et al.

RDFKeyLearner [158] applies TB independently to the values of specific attributes, which are
selected through the following process: each attribute is associated with a discriminability score,
which amounts to the portion of distinct values over all values in the given dataset. If this is
lower than a predetermined threshold, the attribute is ignored due to limited diversity, i.e., too
many entities have the same value(s). For each attribute with high discriminability, its coverage is
estimated, i.e., the portion of entities that contain it. The harmonic mean of discriminability and
coverage is then computed for all valid attributes and the one with the maximum score is selected
for defining blocking keys as long as its score exceeds another predetermined threshold. If not, the
selected attribute is combined with all other attributes and the process is repeated.

Prefix-Infix(-Suffix) Blocking [123] exploits the naming pattern in entity URIs. The prefix describes
the domain of the URI, the infix is a local identifier, and the optional suffix contains details about the
format, or a named anchor [118]. E.g., in the URI https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France#History,
the prefix is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki, the infix is France and the suffix is History. In this
context, this method uses as keys all (URI) infixes along with all tokens in the literal values.

TYPiMatch [96] improves TB by automatically detecting the entity types in the input data. It
creates a co-occurrence graph, where every node corresponds to a token in any attribute value and
every edge connects two tokens if both conditional probabilities of co-occurrence exceed a prede-
termined threshold. The maximal cliques are extracted and merged if their overlap exceeds another
threshold. The resulting clusters correspond to the entity types, with every entity participating in
all types to which its tokens belong. TB is then applied independently to the profiles of each type.
Finally, Semantic Graph Blocking [113] is based exclusively on the relations between entities, be
it foreign keys in a database or links in RDF data. It completely disregards attribute values, building
a collaborative graph, where every node corresponds to an entity and every edge connects two
associated entities. For instance, the collaborative graph for a bibliographic data collection can be
formed by mapping every author to a node and adding edges between co-authors. Then a new block
bi is formed for each node ni , containing all nodes connected with ni through a path, provided that
the path length or the block size do not exceed predetermined limits (proactive functionality).

Learning-based Methods. Hetero [77] converts the input data into heterogeneous structured
datasets using property tables. Then, it maps every entity to a normalized TF vector, and applies
an adapted Hungarian algorithm with linear scalability to produce positive and negative feature
vectors. Finally, it applies FisherDisjunctive [76] with bagging to achieve robust performance.

Similarly, Extended DNF BSL [78] combines an established instance-based schema matcher with

weighted set covering to learn DNF blocking schemes with at most k predicates.

3.4 Parallelization Approaches
To scale Blocking methods to massive entity collections without altering their functionality, the
MapReduce framework [36] is typically used, as it offers fault-tolerant, optimized execution for
applications distributed across a set of independent nodes.

Schema-aware methods. The hash-based, non-learning methods are adapted to MapReduce
in a straightforward way. The map phase implements the transformation function(s), emitting (key,
entity_id) pairs for each entity. Every reducer acts as an assignment function, placing all entities
with blocking key t in block bt . Dedoop [81] provides such implementations for various methods.
For sort-based methods, the adaptation of SN to MapReduce in [83] can be used as a template.
The map function extracts the blocking key(s) from each input entity, while the ensuing partitioning
phase sorts all entities in alphabetical order of their keys. The reduce function slides a window of
fixed size within every reduce partition. Inevitably, entities close to the partition boundaries need
to be compared across different reduce tasks. Thus, the map function is extended to replicate those
entities, forwarding them to the respective reduce task and its successor.

DCS and DCS++ are adapted to the MapReduce framework in [103], using three jobs. The first
one sorts the originally unordered entities of the data partition assigned to each mapper according
to the selected blocking keys. It also selects the boundary pairs of the sorted partitions. The second
job generates the Partition Allocation Matrix, which specifies the sorted partitions to be replicated,
while the third job performs DCS(++) locally, to the data assigned to every reducer.

Schema-agnostic methods. A single MapReduce job is required for parallelizing TB [29, 47].
For every input entity ei , the map function emits a (t, ei ) pair for every token t in the values of ei .
Then, all entities sharing a particular token are directed to the same reducer to form a new block.
For Attribute Clustering Blocking, four MapReduce jobs are required [29, 47]. The first assembles
all values per attribute. The second computes the pairwise similarities between all attributes, even
if they are placed in different data partitions. The third connects every attribute to its most similar
one. The fourth associates every attribute name with a cluster id and adapts TB’s map function to
emit pairs of the form (k.t, i), where k is the cluster id of ei ’s attribute name that contains token t.
Finally, the parallelization of Prefix-Infix(-Suffix) Blocking involves three MapReduce jobs [29, 47].
The first parallelizes the algorithm that extracts the prefixes from a set of URIs [118]. The second
extracts the URI suffixes. The third applies TB’s mapper to the literal values simultaneously with
an infix mapper that emits a pair (j, ei ) for every infix j that is extracted from ei ’s profile. The final
reduce phase ensures that all entities having a common token or infix are placed in the same block.
Load Balancing. For MapReduce, it is crucial to distribute evenly the overall workload among
the available nodes, avoiding potential bottlenecks. The following methods distribute the execution
of comparisons in a block collection - not the cost of building the blocks.

BlockSplit [82] partitions large blocks into smaller sub-blocks and processes them in parallel.
Every entity is compared to all entities in its sub-block as well as to all entities of its super-block,
even if their sub-block is initially assigned to a different node. This yields an additional network
and I/O overhead and may still lead to unbalanced workload, due to sub-blocks of different size.
To overcome this, PairRange [82] splits evenly the comparisons in a set of blocks into a predefined
number of partitions. It involves a single MapReduce job with a mapper that associates every entity
ei in block bk with the output key p.k.i, where p denotes the partition id. The reducer assembles all
entities that have the same p and block id, reproducing the comparisons of each partition.

The space requirements of these two algorithms are improved in [190], which minimizes their

memory consumption by adapting them so that they work with sketches.

Finally, Dis-Dedup [30] is the only method that takes into account both the computational and
the communication cost (e.g., network transfer time, local disk I/O time). Dis-Dedup considers all
possible cases, from disjoint blocks produced by a single blocking technique to overlapping blocks
derived from multiple techniques. It also provides strong theoretical guarantees that the overall
maximum cost per reducer is within a small constant factor from the lower bounds.

3.5 Discussion & Experimental Results
The performance of the above techniques is examined both qualitatively and quantitatively in a
series of individual of papers (e.g., [35, 114, 120, 124]) and experimental analyses (e.g., [25, 116, 132]).
Below, we summarize the main findings in order to facilitate the use of Block Building techniques.
Starting with Standard Blocking (SB), its performance depends heavily on the frequency dis-
tribution of attribute values and, thus, of blocking keys. The best case corresponds to a uniform
distribution, where ||B|| = ||E||/|B| [25]. Due to its lazy functionality, though, all other key distri-
butions yield a portion of large blocks with many superfluous comparisons, i.e., low PQ and RR.
Suffix Arrays Blocking (SA) improves SB’s PC, by supporting errors at the beginning of blocking
keys. The higher lmin is and the lower bmax is, the lower ||B|| and PC get. For the same settings,
Extended SA raises PC at the cost of higher ||B||, which inevitably lowers both PQ and RR. Improved

SA is theoretically proven in [35] to result in a PC greater or equal to that of SA, though at the cost
of a higher computational cost and more comparisons, which lower PQ and RR.

Q-grams Blocking yields higher PC than SB, but decreases both PQ and RR. Extended Q-grams
Blocking raises PQ and RR at a limited, if any, cost in PC. MFIBlocks reduces significantly the
number of blocks and matching candidates (i.e., very high PQ and RR) [79], but it may come at the
cost of missed matches (insufficient PC) in case the resulting blocking keys are very restrictive for
matches with noisy descriptions [132].

For Sorted Neighborhood (SN), a small w leads to high PQ and RR but low PC and vice versa for a
large w. For Extended SN, variations in the window size have a large impact on efficiency (PQ and
RR), affecting the portion of unnecessary comparisons, but PC is more stable. Among the other SN
variants, DCS++ is theoretically proven to miss no matches with an appropriate value for ϕ, while
being at least as efficient as SN. Sorted Blocks New Partition outperforms most SN-based algorithms,
but includes more parameters than SN, involving a more complex configuration.

Most importantly, all these non-learning schema-aware methods are quite parameter-sensitive:
even small parameter value modifications may yield significantly different performance [25, 34,
114, 116]. Their most important parameter is the definition of the blocking keys, which requires
fine-tuning by an expert. Otherwise, their PC remains insufficient, placing most duplicates in no
common block [25, 116]. This applies even to methods that employ redundancy for higher recall.
This shortcoming is ameliorated by schema-agnostic methods, which consistently achieve much
higher PC than their schema-aware counterparts [116]. They also simplify the configuration of
Block Building, reducing its sensitivity through the automatic definition of blocking keys [116, 132].
Rather than human intervention or expert knowledge, their robustness emanates from the high
levels of redundancy they employ, placing every entity in a multitude of blocks. On the downside,
they yield a considerably higher number of comparisons, resulting in very low PQ and RR. Both,
however, can be significantly improved by Block Processing [126, 132].

Regarding the relative performance of schema-agnostic methods, TB yields very high PC, at
the cost of very low PQ and RR. It constitutes a very efficient approach, iterating only once over
the input entities, and it is the sole parameter-free Block Building technique in the literature as
well as the most generic one, applying to any entity collection with textual values. Its performance
is improved by Attribute Clustering and Prefix-Infix(-Suffix) Blocking for specific type of datasets:
highly heterogeneous ones, with a large variety of attribute names [124, 132], and semi-structured
(RDF) ones [120], respectively. In these cases, both methods yield a much larger number of smaller
blocks, significantly raising PQ at a minor cost in PC. Both methods, though, involve a much higher
computational cost than TB. The same applies to TYPiMatch, where the detection of entity types is
a rather time-consuming process. Yet, its PC is consistently insufficient, because it falsely divides
duplicate entities different entity types, due to the sensitivity to its parameter configuration [132].
Finally, the learning-based Block Building techniques typically suffer from the scarcity of labelled
datasets; even if a training set is available for a particular dataset, it cannot be directly used for
learning supervised blocking schemes for another dataset. Instead, a complex transfer learning
procedure is typically required [107, 168]. Regarding their efficiency, BSL is typically faster than
ApproxRBSetCover and ApproxDNF, as it exclusively considers positive instances, thus requiring a
smaller training set. Conjunction Learner requires every supervised blocking scheme to be applied
to the large set of unlabelled data, which is impractical. To accelerate it, a random sample of the
unlabelled data is used in practice. CBLOCK is also the only learning-based method that is suitable
for the MapReduce framework: every entity runs through the learned tree and is directed to the
machine corresponding to its leaf node. In terms of effectiveness, there is no clear winner. BSL and
FisherDisjunctive achieve the top performance in [114]. The latter addresses the scarcity of labelled
data, but is not scalable to large datasets.

4 BLOCK PROCESSING
Block Processing receives as input an existing block collection B and produces as output a new block
collection B ′ that improves the balance between effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., PQ(B) ≪ PQ(B ′),
RR(B ′, B) ≫ 0, while PC(B) ∼ PC(B ′). We distinguish Block Processing methods into Block Cleaning
ones, which decide whether entire blocks should be retained or modified, and Comparison Cleaning
ones, which decide whether individual comparisons are unnecessary.

4.1 Block Cleaning
We classify Block Cleaning methods into two categories: (i) static, which are independent of
matching results, and (ii) dynamic, which are interwoven with the matching process.

Static Methods. A core idea is the assumption that the larger a block is, the less likely it is to
contain unique duplicates, i.e., matches that share no other block. Such large blocks are typically
produced by lazy schema-agnostic techniques and correspond to stop words. In this context, Block
Purging discards blocks that exceed an upper limit on block cardinality [124] or size [123]. Block
Filtering [131] applies this assumption to individual entities, removing every entity from the largest
blocks that contain it. In other words, it retains every entity in r % of its smallest blocks.

On a different line of research, Size-based Block Clustering [52] applies hierarchical clustering
to transform a set of blocks into a new one where all block sizes lie within a specified size range.
It merges recursively small blocks that correspond to similar blocking keys, while splitting large
blocks into smaller ones. A penalty function controls the trade-off between block quality and block
size. A similar approach is the MapReduce-based dynamic blocking algorithm in [102], which splits
large blocks into sub-blocks. MaxIntersectionMerge [106] ensures that all blocks involve at least
|b|min entities. To this end, it merges each block smaller than |b|min entities with the block that has
the most entities in common and is larger than |b|min. Similarly, Rollup Canopies [150] receives as
input a training set with positive examples, a limit on the maximum block size and a set of disjoint
blocks; using a learning-based greedy algorithm, it merges pairs of small blocks to increase PC.

Finally, [143] generalizes Meta-blocking (see Section 4.2) to Multi-source ER: it constructs a
graph, where the nodes correspond to blocks and the edges connect blocks whose blocking keys
are more similar than a predetermined threshold. The edges are weighted using various functions
and all pairs of blocks are then processed in descending edge weights in an effort to maximize the
redundant and superfluous comparisons that are skipped.

Dynamic Methods. Iterative Blocking [183] merges any new pair of detected duplicates, ei and
ej , into a new entity, ei, j , and replaces both ei and ej with ei, j in all blocks that contain them, even
if they have already been processed. The new entity ei, j is compared with all co-occurring entities,
as the new content in ei, j might identify previously missed matches. The ER process terminates
when all blocks have been processed without finding new duplicates.

Iterative Blocking applies exclusively to Deduplication. In Record Linkage, there is no need
for merging two matching entities, due to the 1-1 restriction. Still, the detected duplicates should
be propagated in order to save the superfluous comparisons with their co-occurring entities in
the subsequently processed blocks. The earlier the matches are detected, the more superfluous
comparisons are saved. To this end, Block Scheduling optimizes the processing order of blocks in a
non-iterative way, sorting them in decreasing order of the probability pi (d) that a block bi contains
a pair of duplicates. This is set inversely proportional to block cardinality, i.e., pi (d) = 1/||bi || [156],
or to the minimum size of the inner block, i.e., pi (d) = 1/min|bi,1|, |bi,2|, where |bi,k | ⊂ Ek [120].
The former definition also applies to Iterative Blocking, which does not specify the exact block
processing order, even though this affects significantly the resulting performance [132].

Block Pruning [120] extends Block Scheduling by exploiting the decreasing density of detected
matches in its processing order (i.e., the later a block is processed, the less unique duplicates it

contains). After processing the latest block, it estimates the average number of executed comparisons
per new duplicate. If this ratio falls below a specific threshold, it terminates the ER process.

4.2 Comparison Cleaning
Non-learning Methods. Figure 4 illustrates the family tree of the methods belonging to this
category. The cornerstone method is Comparison Propagation [121], which propagates all executed
comparisons to the subsequently processed blocks. In this manner, it eliminates all redundant
comparisons in a given block collection without losing any pair of duplicates, thus raising PQ and
RR at no cost in PC. It builds an inverted index that points from entity ids to block ids, called Entity
Index, and with its help, it compares two entities ei and ej in block bk only if k is their least common
block id. For example, consider the blocks in Figure 5(a) and their Entity Index in Figure 5(b). The
least common block id of e1 and e3 is 2. Thus, they are compared in b2, but neither in b4 nor in b5.
Given a redundancy-positive block collection, the Entity Index allows for identifying the blocks
shared by a pair of co-occurring entities. This allows for weighting all pairwise comparisons in
proportion to the matching likelihood of the corresponding entities, based on the principle that the
more blocks two entities share, the more likely they are to be matching. This gives rises to a family
of Meta-blocking techniques [125, 131, 154] that go beyond Comparison Propagation by discarding
not only all redundant comparisons, but also the vast majority of the superfluous ones.

The first relevant method is Comparison Pruning [122], which computes the Jaccard co-efficient
of the block lists of two entities. If it does not exceed a conservative threshold that depends on the
average number of blocks per entity, the comparison is pruned, as it designates an unlikely match.
Meta-blocking was formalized into a more principled approach in [125]. The given redundancy-
positive block collection B is converted into a blocking graph GB , where the nodes correspond
to entities and the edges connect every pair of co-occurring entities - see Figure 5(c). Given that
no parallel edges are allowed, all redundant comparisons are discarded by definition. The edges
are then weighted proportionately to the likelihood that the adjacent entities are matching. In
Figure 5(d), the edge weights indicate the number of common blocks. Edges with low weights are
pruned, because they correspond to superfluous comparisons. In Figure 5(e), all edges with a weight
lower than the average one are discarded. The resulting pruned blocking graph GB′ is transformed
into a restructured block collection B ′ by forming one block for every retained edge - see Figure
5(f). As a result, B ′ exhibits a much higher efficiency, PQ(B ′)≫PQ(B) and RR(B ′, B)≫0, for similar
effectiveness, PC(B ′)∼PC(B); in our example, the 12 comparisons in the input blocks of Figure 5(a)
are reduced to 2 matching comparisons in the output blocks in Figure 5(f).

Four main pruning algorithms exist: (i) Weighted Edge Pruning (WEP) removes all edges that do not
exceed a specific threshold, e.g., the average edge weight [125]; (ii) Cardinality Edge Pruning (CEP)

retains the globally K top weighted edges, where K is static [125] or dynamic [195]; (iii) Weighted
Node Pruning (WNP) retains in each node neighborhood the entities that exceed a local threshold,
which may be the average edge weight of each neighborhood [125], or the average of the maximum
weights in the two adjacent node neighborhoods, as in BLAST [154]; (iv) Cardinality Node Pruning
(CNP) retains the top-k weighted edges in each node neighborhood [125]. Reciprocal WNP and
CNP [131] apply an aggressive pruning that retains edges satisfying the pruning criteria in both
adjacent node neighborhoods. WNP and WEP are combined through the weighted sum of their
thresholds in [9].

Another family of pruning algorithms is presented in [106], focusing on the edge weights between
the entities in each block. Low Entity Co-occurrence Pruning (LECP) cleans every block from a
specific portion of the entities with the lowest average edge weights. Large Block Size Pruning
(LBSP) applies LECP only to the blocks whose size exceeds the average block size in the input
block collection. Low Block Co-occurrence Pruning (LBCP) removes every entity from the blocks,
where it is connected with the lowest weights, on average, with the rest of the entities. CooSlicer
enforces a maximum block size constraint, |b|max , to all input blocks. In blocks larger than |b |max
all entities are sorted in decreasing order of average edge weight, and the |b|max top-ranked entities
are iteratively placed into a new block. Low Block Co-occurrence Excluder (LBCE) discards a specific
portion of the blocks with the lowest average edge weight among their entities.

All these pruning algorithms can be coupled with any edge weighting scheme [125]. ARCS sums
the inverse cardinalities of the common blocks, giving higher weights to entity pairs that co-occur
in smaller blocks. CBS counts the number of blocks shared by two entities, as in Figure 5(c), with
ECBS extending it to discount the contribution from entities placed in many blocks. JS corresponds
to the Jaccard coefficient of two block lists, while EJS extends it to discount the contribution from
entities appearing in many non-redundant comparisons. Finally, Pearson’s χ 2 test assesses whether
two adjacent entities appear independently in blocks and can be combined with the aggregate
attribute entropy associated with the tokens forming their common blocks [154].

Note that Meta-blocking covers established methods that are considered as Block Building
methods in the literature: given that Block Building is equivalent to indexing [25], any method
based on indexes is in fact a Meta-blocking technique. For example, Transitive LSH [162] converts the
blocks extracted from LSH into an unweighted blocking graph and applies a community detection
algorithm (e.g., [31]) to partition the graph nodes into disjoint clusters, which will become the new
blocks. The process finishes when the size of the largest cluster is lower than a predetermined
threshold. This approach can be applied on top of any Block Building method, not just LSH.

The generalization principle also applies to Canopy Clustering [101], which places all entities in
a pool and, in every iteration, it removes a random entity ei from the pool to create a new block.
Using a cheap similarity measure, all entities still in the pool are compared with ei . Those exceeding
a threshold tex are removed from the pool and placed into the new block. Entities exceeding another
threshold tin (< tex ) are also placed in the new block, without being removed from the pool. As
the cheap similarity measure, we can use any of the above weighting schemes on top of any Block
Building method, thus turning Canopy Clustering into a pruning algorithm for Meta-blocking.

G. Papadakis et al.

The generalization applies to Extended Canopy Clustering [25, 116], too, which replaces the
sensitive weight thresholds with cardinality ones: for each randomly selected entity, the n1 nearest
entities are placed in its block, while the n2(≤ n1) nearest entities are removed from the pool.

On another line of research, SPAN [153] converts a block collection into a matrix M, where the
rows correspond to entities and the columns to the tf-idf of blocking keys (tokens or q-grams).
Then, the entity-entity matrix is defined as A = MMT . A spectral clustering algorithm converts A
into a binary tree, where the root node contains all entities and every leaf node is a disjoint subset
of entities. The Newman-Girvan modularity is used as the stopping criterion for the bipartition of
the tree. Blocks are then derived from a search procedure that carries out pairwise comparisons
based on the blocking keys, inside the leaf nodes and across the neighboring ones.

Finally, the sole dynamic non-learning method is Comparison Scheduling [124]. Its goal is to
detect most matches upfront so as to maximize the superfluous comparisons that are skipped, due
to the 1-1 restriction. It orders all comparisons in decreasing matching likelihood (edge weight)
and executes a comparison only if none of the involved entities has already been matched.

Learning-based Approaches. Supervised Meta-blocking [129] treats edge pruning as a binary
classification problem, where every edge is labelled "likely match" or "unlikely match". Every
edge is represented by a feature vector that comprises five features: ARCS, ECBS, JS and the Node
Degrees of the adjacent entities. Undersampling is employed to tackle the class imbalance problem:
the training set comprises just 5% of the minority class ("likely match") and an equal number of
majority class instances. Several established classification algorithms are used for WEP, CEP and
CNP, with all of them exhibiting robust performance with respect to their internal configuration.
BLOSS [15] restricts the labelling cost of Supervised Meta-blocking by carefully selecting a
training set that is up to 40 times smaller, but retains the original performance. Using ECBS weights,
it partitions the unlabelled instances into similarity levels and applies rule-based active sampling
inside every level. Then, it cleans the sample from non-matching outliers with high JS weights.

Parallelization Approaches. Meta-blocking is adapted to the MapReduce framework in three
ways [46]: (i) The edge-based strategy stores the blocking graph on the disk, bearing a significant
I/O cost. (ii) The comparison-based strategy builds the blocking graph implicitly. A pre-processing
job enriches every block with the list of block ids associated with every entity. The Map phase
of the second job computes the edge weights and discards all redundant comparisons, while the
ensuing Reduce phase prunes superfluous comparisons. This strategy maximizes the efficiency of
WEP and CEP and is adapted to Apache Spark in [9]. (iii) The entity-based strategy aggregates for
every entity the bag of all entities that co-occur with it in at least one block. Then, it estimates the
edge weight that corresponds to each neighbor based on its frequency in the co-occurrence bag.
This approach offers the best implementation for WNP and CNP and their variations (e.g., BLAST).
It is adapted to Apache Spark in [155], leveraging the broadcast join for higher efficiency.

To avoid the underutilization of the available resources, these strategies employ MaxBlock [46]
for load balancing. Based on the highly skewed distribution of block sizes in redundancy-positive
block collections, it splits the input blocks into partitions of equivalent computational cost, which
is equal to the total number of comparisons in the largest input block.

The multi-core parallelization of Meta-blocking is examined in [117]. The input is transformed
into an array of chunks, with an index indicating the next chunk to be processed. Following the
established fork-join model, every thread retrieves the current value of the index and is assigned
to process the corresponding chunk. Depending on the definition of chunks, three alternative
strategies are proposed: (i) Naive Parallelization treats every entity as a separate chunk, ordering
all entities in decreasing computational cost (i.e., the aggregate number of comparisons in the
associated blocks). (ii) Partition Parallelization uses MaxBlock to group the input entities into an

arbitrary number of disjoint clusters with identical computational cost. (iii) Segment Parallelization
sets the number of clusters equal to the number of available cores.

4.3 Discussion & Experimental Results
The core characteristic of Block Processing methods is their schema-agnostic functionality, which
typically relies on block features, such as size, cardinality and overlap. This is no surprise, as they
are primarily crafted for boosting the performance of schema-agnostic Block Building methods. In
fact, extensive experiments demonstrate that Block Processing is indispensable for these methods,
raising precision by whole orders of magnitude, at a minor cost in recall [124, 130, 132].

Regarding their relative performance, there is no clear winner among the Block Cleaning methods.
For example, both Block Filtering and Block Purging boost PQ and RR by orders of magnitude,
while exhibiting a low computational cost and a negligible impact on PC [124, 131]. However, the
top performer among them depends not only on their parameter configuration, but also on the data
at hand [132]. Most importantly, though, Block Cleaning techniques are usually complementary in
the sense that multiple ones can be applied consecutively in a single blocking workflow, as depicted
in Figure 1(b). For example, Block Filtering is typically applied after Block Purging by lowering r to
50% instead of 80%, which is the best configuration when applied independently [130–132].

In contrast, Comparison Cleaning methods are incompatible with each other in the sense that at
most one of them can be part of a blocking workflow. The reason is that applying any Comparison
Cleaning technique to a redundancy-positive block collection deprives it from its co-occurrence
patterns and renders all other techniques inapplicable. These techniques also involve a much higher
computational cost than Block Cleaning methods, due to their finer level of granularity. Their
relative performance is summarized in Figure 6, based on empirical evidence from experimental
studies [132] and individual publications [15, 129–131, 154, 155]. Note that we exclude methods
not compared to other Comparison Cleaning techniques (e.g., the techniques presented in [106]).
In more detail, Figure 6 maps the performance of the main Comparison Cleaning methods to a two
dimensional space defined by ∆PC=PC(B ′) − PC(B) on the vertical axis and ∆PQ=PQ(B ′) − PQ(B)
on the horizontal axis, where B and B ′ stand for the input and the output block collections,
respectively. Given that Comparison Cleaning techniques trade lower recall (PC) for higher precision
(PQ), ∆PC and ∆PQ take exclusively negative and positive values, respectively. Therefore, the higher
a method is placed, the better recall it achieves, whereas the further to the right it lies, the better is
its precision. This means that the ideal overall performance corresponds to the upper right corner.
We observe that ∆PC is delimited by two extremes: Comparison Cleaning on the top left corner
and CEP on the bottom right corner. The former has no impact on recall, as it increases precision
only by removing redundant comparisons. All other Comparison Cleaning techniques discard
superfluous comparisons, too, thus achieving larger ∆PQ at the cost of a negative ∆PC. On the
other extreme, CEP prunes a large portion of superfluous comparisons, yielding very high precision,

but the lowest recall. WEP replaces CEP’s cardinality constraint with a weight threshold, dropping
precision to a large extent for a significantly higher recall. Still, WEP’s performance is a major
improvement over the input block collection, while being rather robust across numerous datasets.
WNP moves further towards this direction, shrinking the decrease in recall and the increase in
precision. This is further improved by Reciprocal WNP, which significantly raises WNP’s precision
for slightly lower recall. Thus, it dominates WEP, albeit being sensitive to the characteristics of the
data at hand. Compared to CEP, CNP confines its pruning inside individual node neighborhoods. In
this way, it achieves a much higher recall for a limited decrease in precision. This is further improved
by Reciprocal CNP, which reduces CNP’s recall slightly for much higher precision and, thus, it
often dominates CEP. WNP, CNP and their variants are improved by Supervised Meta-blocking and
BLAST, which achieve comparable recall for significantly higher precision. BLAST takes a lead
in precision, partially because it employs the most effective weighting scheme, namely Pearson’s
χ 2 test. Another advantage is that BLAST requires no labeling effort, due to its unsupervised
functionality. BLOSS, however, achieves almost perfect recall (∆PC ≈ 0) for the highest precision
among all Comparison Cleaning techniques, while requiring merely ∼50 labeled instances. Note
that exceptions to these general patterns of performance are possible for a particular dataset.

5 FILTERING
Given specific similarity predicates, comprising a similarity measure and a corresponding threshold,
Filtering techniques receive as input an entity or a block collection and produce as output pairs of
entities satisfying these predicates. Next, we present the main filtering methods in the literature,
organized in four groups: basic filters proposed by earlier works; prefix filtering and its extensions;
partition-based filtering; and methods using tree indexes. An overview of the discussed methods is
presented in Table 2, characterized by the type of operation they perform (e.g., search or join), the
similarity measure they assume (e.g., token- or character-based), the type of filters they use (e.g.,
prefix- or partition-based) and the index structure they employ (e.g., inverted index or tree).

Basic filtering. GramCount [61] focuses on incorporating string similarity joins inside a DBMS

based on q-grams and edit distance. It is the first work to propose the following techniques:

Length filtering states that if two strings r and s are within edit distance θ , their lengths cannot
differ by more than θ . In the case of set similarity joins, the length filter has been adapted to deal
with set sizes [7]; e.g., for Jaccard similarity threshold θ , the condition becomes θ · |s | ≤ |r | ≤ |s |/θ .
Length filtering is a simple but effective criterion that is employed by many other works alongside
more advanced filters. A position-enhanced length filter offers a tighter upper bound [98].

Count filtering states that if two strings r and s are within edit distance θ , they must have at least
max(|r |, |s |) − 1 − (θ − 1) · q common q-grams. This filter has also been adapted to sets, in particular
in MergeOpt [148], which proposed various optimizations for applying count filtering with both
character-based and token-based similarity measures, and in DivideSkip [87], which proposed
efficient techniques for merging the inverted lists of signatures.

Position filtering also considers the positions of q-grams in the strings. It states that if two strings
r and s are within edit distance θ , a positional q-gram in one cannot correspond to a positional
q-gram in the other that differs from it by more than θ positions.

On another line of research, FastSS [18] introduces the concept of deletion neighborhood, a
filtering criterion specifically tailored to edit distance. For a string s, its deletion neighborhood
contains substrings of s derived by deleting a certain number of characters. These are then used as
signatures for filtering. However, this method is practical only for very short strings.

Prefix-based filtering. Prefix filtering has been proposed by SSJoin [22], which focuses on
similarity joins inside a DBMS, and All-Pairs [12], which is a main memory algorithm. Prefix
filter applies to sets and can also be used for strings represented as sets of q-grams. The elements

(d) Algorithms for complex matching
of each set are first sorted in a global order, typically in increasing order of frequency. Then, the
π -prefix of each set is formed by selecting its π first elements in that order. Prefix filter states that
for two sets to be similar, their prefixes must contain at least one common element. The prefix size
π of a set r is determined based on the similarity measure and threshold being used; e.g., for edit
distance threshold θ , π = q · θ + 1, while for Jaccard similarity threshold θ , π = ⌊(1 − θ ) · |r |⌋ + 1.
As described next, numerous subsequent algorithms have adopted prefix filtering and proposed
various optimizations and extensions over it, both for edit distance and set-based similarity joins.
For edit distance, DivideSkip [87] uses prefix filtering in combination with length and position
filtering, taking special care to efficiently merge the inverted lists of signatures. Ed-Join [184]
proposes two optimizations based on analyzing the locations and contents of mismatching q-grams
to further reduce the prefix length by removing unnecessary elements. QChunk [137] introduces the
concept of q-chunks, which are substrings of length q that start at 1+i·q positions in the string, for
i ∈ [0, (|r | − 1)/q]. Given two strings r and s, QChunk extracts q-grams from the one and q-chunks

22

G. Papadakis et al.

from the other; if r and s are within edit distance θ , the size of the intersection between the q-grams
of r and the q-chunks of s should be at least ⌈|s |/q⌉-θ . VChunkJoin [180] uses non-overlapping
substrings called chunks, ensuring that each edit operation destroys at most two chunks. This yields
a tight lower bound on the number of common chunks that two strings must share if they match.
For set similarity joins, PPJoin [186, 187] extends prefix filtering with positional filtering. This
takes also into consideration the positions where the common tokens in the prefix occur, thus
deriving a tighter upper bound for the overlap between the two sets. In addition, PPJoin+ [186, 187]
further uses suffix filtering. Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, this partitions the suffix of
the one set into two subsets of similar sizes. The token separating the two partitions is called pivot
and is used to split the suffix of the other set. This allows to calculate the maximum number of
tokens in each pair of corresponding partitions between the two sets that can match.

MPJoin [144] adds a further optimization over PPJoin that allows for dynamically pruning the
length of the inverted lists. This reduces the computational cost of candidate generation, rather than
the number of candidates. GroupJoin [19] extended PPJoin with group filtering, whose candidate
generation treats all sets with identical prefixes as a single set. Multiple candidates may thus be
pruned in batches. AdaptJoin [173] proposed adaptive prefix filtering, which generalizes prefix
filtering by adaptively selecting an appropriate prefix length for each set. It supports longer prefixes
dynamically, extending their length by n − 1, and then prunes a pair of sets if they contain less
than n common tokens in their extended prefixes. Prefix filtering is a special case where n = 1.

A different perspective for speeding up set similarity joins is proposed by SKJ [181]. The idea
is based on the following observation: existing approaches examine each set individually when
computing the join; however, it is possible to improve efficiency through computational cost sharing
between related sets. To this end, the SKJ algorithm introduces index-level skipping, which groups
related sets in the index into blocks, and answer-level skipping, which incrementally generates the
answer of one set from an already computed answer of another related set.

Finally, there are Filtering techniques for computing top-k results progressively, instead of
requiring the user to select a similarity threshold. TopkJoin [185] retrieves the top-k pairs of sets
ranked by their similarity score, based on prefix filtering and on the monotonicity of maximum
possible scores of unseen pairs. JOSIE [199] presents a method for top-k set similarity search. It
exploits prefix and position filtering but, instead of dealing with sets of relatively small size (e.g.,
∼100 tokens), it is crafted for finding joinable tables in data lakes, where sets represent the distinct
values of a table column, comprising millions of tokens. This introduces new challenges, which are
tackled by proposing an algorithm that minimizes the cost of set reads and inverted index probes.
Partition-based filtering. The algorithms in this category partition each string or set into
multiple disjoint segments in such a way that matching pairs have at least one common segment.
PartEnum [7] generates a signature scheme based on the principles of partitioning and enumeration.
The former states that if two vectors with Hamming distance not higher than k are partitioned into
k + 1 equi-sized partitions, then they must have at least one common partition. The latter states
that if these vectors are partitioned instead into n > k equi-sized partitions, then they must have
in common at least n − k partitions. PassJoin [88] partitions a string into a set of segments and
creates inverted indices for the segments. Then, for each string, it selects some of its substrings and
uses them to retrieve candidates from the index. A method is proposed to minimize the number
of segments required to find the candidates pairs. PTJ [38] proposes an approach to increase the
pruning power of partition-based filtering by using a mixture of the subsets and their 1-deletion
neighborhoods, which are subsets derived from a set after eliminating one element.

Essentially, these methods are based on the pigeonhole principle, which states that if n items
are contained in m boxes, at least one box has no more than ⌊n/m⌋ items. This is extended by
the pigeonring principle [138], which organizes the boxes in a ring and constrains the number

, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: August 2020.

Blocking and Filtering

23

of items in multiple boxes rather than a single one, thus offering tighter bounds. Applying it to
various similarity search problems shows that pigeonring always produces less or equal number
of candidates than the pigeonhole principle does and that pigeonring-based algorithms can be
implemented on top of existing pigeonhole-based ones with minor modifications [138].

Tree-based filtering. Most methods presented so far build inverted indexes on the signatures

extracted from the strings or sets. Next, we present algorithms employing tree-based indexes.

Most approaches are based on the B+-tree. Bed -Tree [198] proposes a B+-tree based index for
range and top-k similarity queries as well as similarity joins, using edit distance. It is based on
a mapping from the string space to the integer space to support efficient searching and pruning.
PBI [93] uses a B+-tree index and exploits the fact that edit distance is a metric. The string collection
is partitioned according to a set of selected reference strings. Then, the strings in each partition are
indexed based on their distances to their corresponding reference strings. The proposed approach
supports both range and k-NN queries and can be integrated inside a DBMS. In MultiTree [196],
each element in a set is represented as a vector and is mapped to an integer according to a defined
global ordering, which is then used to insert the element in the B+-tree index. Searching for similar
elements is then done via a range query on the index.

On another line of research, Trie-Join [172] proposes a trie-based technique for string similarity
joins with edit distance. Each trie node represents a character in the string. Thus, strings with a
common prefix share the same ancestors. A trie node is called an active node of a string s if their
edit distance is not larger than the given threshold. This leads to a technique called subtrie pruning:
given a trie T and a string s, if node n is not an active node for every prefix of s, then n’s descendants
cannot be similar to s. HSTree [192] recursively partitions strings into disjoint segments and builds
a hierarchical segment tree index. This is then used to support both threshold-based and top-k
string similarity search based on edit distance. Finally, a transformation-based framework for top-k
set similarity search is presented in [197]. It transforms sets of various lengths into fixed-length
vectors in such a way that similar sets are mapped closer to each other. An R-tree is then used to
index these records and prune the space during search.

5.1 Parallel & Distributed Algorithms
MapReduce-based approaches have been proposed to tackle scalability issues when dealing with
very large collections of sets or strings. A theoretical analysis of different methods for performing
similarity joins on MapReduce is presented in [2]. It considers algorithms that operate in a single
MapReduce job, avoiding the overhead associated with initiating multiple ones. It shows that
different algorithms provide different tradeoffs with respect to map, reduce and communication cost.
VernicaJoin [170] is based on prefix filtering. It computes prefix tokens and builds an inverted
index on them. Then, it generates candidate pairs from the inverted lists, using additionally the
length, positional and suffix filters to prune candidates. A deduplication step is finally employed
to remove duplicate result pairs generated from different reducers. MGJoin [147] follows a similar
approach to VernicaJoin, but introduces multiple prefix orders and a load balancing technique
that partitions sets based on their length. MRGroupJoin [38] is a MapReduce extension of PTJ [38].
It applies a partition-based technique, where records are grouped by length and are partitioned in
subrecords, such that matching records share at least one subrecord. The process is performed in a
single MapReduce job. FS-Join [146] sorts the tokens in each set in increasing order of frequency,
and then splits each set into disjoint subsets using appropriate pivot tokens. These subsets are then
grouped together so that subsets from different groups are non-overlapping.

Finally, Dima [164, 165] is a distributed in-memory system built on top of Spark that supports
threshold and top-k similarity search and join with both token-based and character-based similari-
ties. It relies on signature-based global and local indexes for efficiency. The proposed signatures

are adaptively selectable based on the workload, which allows to balance the workload among
partitions. Dima extends the Catalyst optimizer of Spark SQL to introduce cost-based optimizations.

5.2 Approximate Algorithms
Approximate algorithms for similarity search and join increase the efficiency of Filtering step at
the cost of allowing both false positives and false negatives, thus missing some matches [10, 176].
They typically rely on locality sensitive hashing (LSH) [56], which transforms an item to a low-
dimensional representation such that similar items have much higher probability to be mapped to
the same hash code than dissimilar ones. This property allows LSH to be exploited in the filtering
phase to generate candidates [33, 94, 167]. The basic idea is that each object is hashed several times
using randomly chosen hash functions. Then, candidates are those pairs of objects that have been
hashed to the same code by at least one hash function.

ATLAS [194] is a probabilistic algorithm that is based on random permutations both to generate
candidates and to estimate the similarity between candidate pairs. It also proposes a method
to efficiently detect cluster structures within the data, which are then exploited to search for
similar pairs only within each cluster. BayesLSH [151] combines Bayesian inference with LSH
to estimate similarities to a user-specified level of accuracy. It uses LSH for both Filtering and
Verification, providing probabilistic guarantees on the resulting accuracy and recall. CPSJoin [28]
is a randomized algorithm for set similarity joins. It uses a recursive filtering technique, building
upon a previously proposed index for set similarity search [27], as well as sketches for estimating
set similarity. The algorithm has 100% precision and provides a probabilistic guarantee on recall.

5.3 Algorithms for Complex Matching
The works discussed so far assume a single similarity predicate, i.e, they apply to the values of a
specific attribute. Moreover, when comparing sets, they assume binary matching between their
elements, while in the case of strings, they compare strings in their entirety. In the following, we
present methods that employ multiple similarity predicates or more complex ones.

Local matching. A local string similarity join finds pairs of strings that contain similar substrings.
Under edit distance constraints, it can be defined as matching any l-length substring with up to k
errors. LS-Join [177] is based on the observation that if two strings are locally similar, they must
share at least one common q-gram, for a suitably calculated gram length q. An inverted index is
constructed incrementally during the search. For every examined string, its q-grams are generated
and the candidates are retrieved from the index by finding those strings that have matching q-grams.
pkwise [178] detects pieces of text in a given collection that share similar sliding windows, i.e.,
multisets containing w consecutive tokens of a given document. The similarity of two sliding
windows is defined as the overlap of those sets. Prefix filtering is used but instead of relying on
single tokens to build the signatures, it proposes k-wise signatures, which comprise combinations
of k tokens. Larger values of k increase the signatures’ selectivity but also the cost of signature
generation. An additional optimization is to share common signatures across adjacent windows.
Finally, pkduck [166] matches strings with abbreviations, based on a new similarity measure that
accounts for abbreviations. It also proposes an appropriate signature scheme that extends prefix
filtering and generates signatures without iterating over all strings derived from an abbreviation.
Fuzzy matching. Rather than assuming a binary match, in this setting, the similarity between
the elements of two sets may take any value between 0 and 1. In fact, it is defined as the maximum
matching score in the bipartite graph representing the matches between their elements.

In Fast-Join [174], edge weights in this bipartite graph denote the edit similarities between
matching elements. The proposed method follows the filter-verification framework, creating a
signature for each set such that matching sets have overlapping signatures. The signature of a set

, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: August 2020.

Blocking and Filtering

25

comprises an appropriately selected subset of its tokens. SilkMoth [37] generalizes and improves
upon this work, providing a formal characterization of the space of valid signatures. Given that
finding the optimal signature is NP-complete, it proposes heuristics to select signatures. To further
reduce candidates, a refinement step is added: it compares each set with its candidates and rejects
those for which certain bounds do not hold. Both edit distance and Jaccard coefficient are supported
for measuring the similarity between elements. MF-Join [175] performs element- and record-level
filtering. The former utilizes a partition-based signature scheme with a frequency-aware partition
strategy, while the latter exploits count filtering and an upper bound on record-level similarity.

Multiple predicates. A method for similarity search and join on multi-attribute data is presented
in [89]. For instance, given an entity collection where each entity is described by its name and
address, this work identifies pairs of entities having both similar names and similar addresses.
To enable simultaneous filtering on multiple attributes, a combined prefix tree index is built on
these attributes. The construction of the index is guided by a cost model and a greedy algorithm.
In another direction, Smurf [163] performs string matching between two collections of strings
based on multiple-predicate matching conditions in the form of a random forest classifier that is
learned via active learning. Filtering techniques for string similarity joins are exploited to speed
up the execution of the random forest. The focus and novelty of this work is on how to reuse
computations across the trees in the forest to further increase efficiency. Finally, AU-Join [188]
presents a new framework for string similarity joins that supports not only syntactic similarity
measures, such as Jaccard similarity on q-grams, but also semantic similarities, including synonym-
based and taxonomy-based matching. It partitions strings into segments and applies different types
of similarity measures on different pairs of segments. A new signature scheme, called pebble, handles
multiple similarity measures: pebbles are q-grams for gram-based similarity, the left-hand side of a
synonym rule for synonym similarity, and ancestor nodes in the taxonomy for taxonomy similarity.

5.4 Discussion & Experimental Results
Filtering techniques for string and set similarity joins have attracted a lot of research interest over
the past two decades. Early works view this operation as an extension of the standard join operator
in relational databases, where the join condition is based on similarity rather than equality [22, 61].
The same perspective is shared by more recent works, like those proposing B+-tree based indexes,
which can be easily integrated into an existing DBMS [93, 196, 198]. Another characteristic example
is Dima [164, 165], which extends the Catalyst optimizer of Spark SQL to support similarity-based
queries. In this sense, similarity joins are sometimes referred to as approximate or fuzzy joins,
although this should not be confused with the approximate algorithms in Sec. 5.2, or the fuzzy
set joins in Sec. 5.3. Numerous Filtering techniques have been proposed by more recent works,
which focus on main memory execution. Prefix-based filtering is the most popular approach [12, 19,
22, 87, 137, 144, 173, 180, 184, 186, 186, 187, 187], followed by partition-based filtering [7, 38, 88].
Furthermore, to scale similarity joins to large collections, distributed [2, 38, 146, 147, 164, 165, 170]
and approximate [28, 151, 194] algorithms have been proposed.

More recently, there has been an increasing focus and interest on works that deal with more
complex similarity predicates. These include the matching of strings based on substrings or abbre-
viations [166, 177, 178], matching of sets based on fuzzy matching of their elements [37, 174, 175],
and the combination of multiple similarity predicates [89, 163]. These works can be considered as
more closely relevant to matching entity profiles in Entity Resolution.

Regarding performance, a series of experimental analyses provides interesting insights [51, 68, 99].
However, each study focuses on a certain subset of the aforementioned methods. Below, we briefly
summarize their findings, including additional results from individual papers to fill the gaps.

Similarity joins using Edit Distance. A comparison between FastSS, All-Pairs, DivideSkip,
Ed-Join, QChunk, VChunkJoin, PPJoin, PPJoin+, AdaptJoin, PartEnum, PassJoin and Trie-Join
is conducted in [68]. The results demonstrate that PassJoin is the most efficient algorithm, with
FastSS providing a reliable alternative in the case of very short strings.

Similarity joins using set-based measures. AdaptJoin and PPJoin+ are reported as the best
algorithms in the aforementioned study [68]. Different results, though, are reported in a subsequent
study that compares All-Pairs, PPJoin, PPJoin+, MPJoin, AdaptJoin and GroupJoin. It indicates
that the plain prefix filtering, i.e., All-Pairs, is still quite competitive, winning in the majority
of cases. PPJoin and GroupJoin exhibit the best median and average performance, respectively,
while more sophisticated filters are found to provide only moderate improvements in some cases
or even to negatively affect performance. The difference with the results in [68] is attributed to
the more efficient verification step; reducing the cost of Verification means that complex and, thus,
time-consuming filters often do not pay off, despite reducing the number of candidate pairs.

Prefix vs. partition filtering. PTJ is compared against PPJoin+ and AdaptJoin in [38], showing that
it outperforms both methods. The same comparison is performed in [181], showing that PTJ does not
outperform those methods in most cases. As noted in [181], this discrepancy seems to be caused by
differences in implementation; specifically, the comparison in [38] uses the original implementations
of PPJoin+ and AdaptJoin, while the one in [181] uses the optimized implementations provided
by [99]. Overall, PTJ may generate fewer candidates, but uses complex index structures, thus
spending much more time on the filtering phase compared to prefix-based algorithms. Another
factor that affects the performance of prefix filtering is the frequency distribution of the tokens in
the dataset. The core idea of prefix filtering is to select rare tokens as signatures so as to reduce the
number of candidates. In [68], an experiment involving different dataset distributions shows that
PPJoin(+) and AdaptJoin perform better in datasets with Zipfian distribution than uniform one.
Set relations. Another interesting finding is that set relations can be effectively exploited to speed
up the computation of similarity joins [181]. In the presented experiments, the proposed algorithm,
SKJ, consistently outperforms PPJoin, PPJoin+, AdaptJoin and PTJ across all datasets.

Tree-based algorithms. These algorithms typically focus on similarity search rather than join.
HSTree and PBI are compared against Bed -Tree in [192] and [93], respectively, reporting better
performance. Also, Trans shows better performance than MultiTree in [197]. BiTrieJoin, an
improved variant of TrieJoin, is reported in [68] to have comparable performance to PassJoin
for short strings, but it underperforms for medium and long strings.

Distributed algorithms. VernicaJoin, MGJoin, MRGroupJoin and FS-Join are experimentally
compared in [51]. VernicaJoin exhibits the best performance in most cases, but all algorithms are
often outperformed by non-distributed ones. This should be attributed to the overhead introduced
by the MapReduce framework as well as to high or skewed data replication between map and
reduce tasks. The latter constitutes an inherent limitation of the distributed algorithms that cannot
be overcome by simply increasing the number of nodes in the cluster. In [164], Dima is shown to
outperform the adaptation of VernicaJoin to Apache Spark.

Approximate algorithms. The experimental survey in [68] included a comparison between
BayesLSH-lite and exact algorithms. Moreover, ATLAS, BayesLSH and CPSJoin have been com-
pared against All-Pairs in [194], [151] and [28], respectively. Overall, the experiments indicate
that approximate algorithms are preferable for low similarity thresholds, e.g., for Jaccard similarity
below 0.5, while exact algorithms perform better for high thresholds.

6 JOIN-BASED BLOCKING METHODS
We now elaborate on Block Building methods that incorporate Filtering techniques, converting
Blocking into a nearest neighbor search. As illustrated in Figure 7(a), we categorize these hybrid

evolution of Blocking, Filtering and their convergence.

techniques into three major categories according to the filtering techniques they employ: the
lossless ones rely on exact, single predicate filtering techniques (cf. Table 2(a)), the lossy ones rely
on approximate filtering (cf. Section 5.2), while the spatial ones leverage spatial join techniques
for filtering. Note that the lossy hybrid methods are further distinguished into static and dynamic
ones, depending on whether they are independent or interwoven with Matching, respectively.

Starting with the lossless hybrid methods, the simplest approach is to combine Prefix Filtering
with Token Blocking, creating one block for every token that appears in the prefix of at least
two entities [29]. Another approach is Adaptive Filtering [63], which couples schema-aware, non-
learning Block Building techniques with two filtering methods. First, blocks are created by extracting
keys from specific attributes. In every block with a size exceeding a predetermined threshold, Length
and Count Filtering are applied for Comparison Cleaning, using an edit distance threshold on an
attribute that is not considered by the initial transformation function.

Another lossless hybrid method is LIMES, which operates only on metric spaces [111]. Its core
idea is to leverage the triangle inequality to approximate the distance between entities based on
previous comparisons. Utilizing sets of entities as reference points, called exemplars, this method
computes lower and upper bounds to filter out superfluous comparisons before their execution.

In another direction, MultiBlock [66] optimizes the execution of complex matching rules that
comprise special similarity functions for textual, geographic and numeric values. A block collection
is created for every similarity function such that similar entities share multiple blocks. E.g., edit
distance is supported for textual values and blocks are created for character q-grams such that
entity pairs satisfying the distance threshold co-occur in a sufficient number of blocks. Then, all
block collections are aggregated into a multidimensional index that respects the co-occurrence
patterns of similar entities and guarantees no false dismissals, i.e., PC=1.

Regarding the lossy approaches, they are dominated by techniques based on LSH [56], which
efficiently estimates the similarity between two attribute values vi and vj by randomly sampling
hash functions f from a sim-sensitive family F such that the probability Pr (f (vi ) = f (vj )) equals
to sim(vi , vj ) for any pair of attribute values and any function f ∈ F . This means that LSH derives
sim(vi , vj ) from the proportion of hash functions f such that f (vi ) = f (vj ). Typically, the required
number of these functions is relatively small for a sufficiently small sampling error; e.g., for 500
functions, the maximum sampling error is about ±4.5% with 95% confidence interval [43].

In the context of ER, LSH is typically combined with MinHash signatures [20], which efficiently
estimate the Jaccard similarity as follows [62, 162]. Given an entity collection E, the values of
selected attribute names are converted into a bag of k-shingles, i.e., k consecutive words or characters.
Then, a matrix M of size K × |E | is formed, with the rows corresponding to the K distinct shingles
that appear in all attribute values and the columns to the input entities. The value of every cell
M(i, j) indicates whether the entity ej contains the shingle sj , M(i, j)=1, or not, M(i, j)=0. Given that
M is a sparse matrix, p random minhash functions are used to reduce its dimensionality: they are
applied to each column, deriving a new matrix M ′ of size p × |E |. The p rows are then partitioned

into b non-overlapping bands and a hash function is applied to every band of each column. The
resulting buckets are treated as blocks that provide probabilistic guarantees that the pairs of similar
entities co-occur in at least one block. In fact, the desired probabilistic guarantees can be used for
configuring the parameters of LSH, i.e., the number of hash functions, rows and bands [62].

In this context, LSH is combined with K-Means in KLSH [162]. KMeans is applied to the low-
dimensional columns of M ′, which represent the input entities. The resulting clusters form a disjoint
block collection B, with |B| determined by the desired average number of entities per block.

LSH is applied to the distributed representations (i.e., embeddings) of the input entities in DeepER
[44]. Every entity is transformed into a dense, real-valued vector by aggregating the embeddings of
all attribute value tokens, which are pre-trained by word2vec [105], Glove [135] etc. This vector is
then hashed into multiple buckets with LSH. A block is then created for every entity containing its
top-N most likely matches, which are detected using Multiprobe-LSH [94].

LSH is also combined with a semantic similarity in SA-LSH (i.e., semantic-aware LSH) [179]. A
taxonomy tree is used to model the concepts that describe the input entity collection. The semantic
similarity of two entities is inversely proportional to the length of the paths that connect the
corresponding concepts and their children: the longer the paths, the lower the semantic similarity.
The concepts of every entity are converted into a hash signature through a semantic hashing
algorithm. The resulting low-dimensional signatures are directly combined with the signatures
that are extracted from the n-grams of selected attribute values, capturing the textual similarity of
entities. However, the construction of the taxonomy tree requires heavy human intervention.

Regarding the dynamic lossy methods, LSH is combined with R-Swoosh [14] in [97] through a
MapReduce parallelization. Initially, a job is used for defining blocks using LSH. Then, a graph-
parallel Pregel-based platform applies R-Swoosh, iteratively executing the non-redundant compar-
isons in the blocks and computing the transitive closure of the detected duplicates.

LSH also lies at the core of cBV-HB [74, 75], which embeds the textual values of selected attributes
into a compact binary Hamming space that is efficient, due to the limited size of its embeddings
(e.g., 120 bits for 4 attributes), and preserves the original distances in the sense that certain types of
errors correspond to specific distance bounds. Special care is taken to support composite matching
rules that involve the main logical operators (i.e., AND, OR and NOT).

Similarly, HARRA [80] uses LSH to hash similar entities into the same buckets. Inside every bucket,
all pairwise comparisons are executed and duplicates are merged into new profiles. The new profiles
are hashed into the existing hash tables and the process is repeated until no entities are merged or
another stopping criterion is met (e.g., the portion of merged profiles drops below a predetermined
threshold). In every iteration, special care is taken to avoid redundant and superfluous comparisons.
Finally, spatial hybrid methods combine spatial joins with Block Building. The core approach is
StringMap [69], which converts schema-aware blocking keys to a similarity-preserving Euclidean
space, whose dimensionality d is heuristically derived from a random sample (typically, d ∈ [15, 25]).
For each dimension, a linear algorithm initially selects two pivot attribute values that are (ideally)
as far apart as possible. Subsequently, the coordinates of all other attribute values are determined
through a comparison with the pivot strings. Using an R-tree or a grid-based index in combination
with two weight thresholds, similar attribute values are clustered together into overlapping blocks.
This approach is enhanced by Extended StringMap [25], which replaces the weight thresholds
with cardinality ones, and the Double embedding scheme [1]. The latter initially maps the input
entities to the same d-dimensional Euclidean space. Next, the embedded attribute values are mapped
to another Euclidean space of lower dimensionality d ′ < d. A similarity join is performed in the
second Euclidean space using a k-d tree index. The resulting candidate matches are then clustered in
the first, d-dimensional Euclidean space. The experimental study suggests that the d ′-dimensional
space significantly reduces the runtime of StringMap by 30% to 60%.

7 BLOCKING VS FILTERING: COMMONALITIES AND DIFFERENCES
The timeline in Figure 7(b) summarizes the landmarks in the evolution of the two frameworks
showing their gradual convergence. We observe that Blocking is the oldest discipline, with the first
relevant technique, namely SB, presented in 1969 [50]. For several decades, research focused on
schema-based techniques, with the most significant breakthrough taking place in 1995, with the
introduction of SN [64]. The first schema-agnostic Block Building technique is Semantic Graph
Blocking [113], introduced in 2007, but it considers only entity links. In 2011, it was followed by
TB [120], which exclusively applies to textual values. Block Processing was introduced in 2009 by
Iterative Blocking [183], followed by the use of Canopy Clustering for Blocking in 2012 [25] and
the introduction of Meta-blocking in 2014 [125]. For Filtering, the first similarity join to be used in
an RDBMS can be traced back to 2001 [61], while the techniques for in-memory execution were
coined in 2007 [12]. Attempts to further increase efficiency by allowing approximate results were
first presented in 2011 [194]. The first works on massive parallelization for Filtering appear in 2010
[170], for Blocking in 2012 [81], and for Block Processing in 2015 [45]. The convergence of the two
frameworks essentially starts in 2011 with MultiBlock [66], which introduces Join-based Blocking,
whereas multiple-predicate Filtering for efficient Matching, is introduced by Smurf in 2018 [163].
Regarding the qualitative comparison of the two frameworks, we observe that they have a
number of commonalities: (i) Both serve the same purpose: they increase ER efficiency by reducing
the number of performed comparisons. To this end, both employ a stage producing candidate
matches, which are subsequently examined analytically in order to remove false positives. (ii)
Both usually operate either on two clean but overlapping data collections (Record Linkage for
Blocking, Cross-table Join for Filtering) or on a single dirty data collection (Deduplication for
Blocking, Self-join for Filtering). (iii) Both extract signatures such that the similarity of two entities
is reflected in the similarity of their signatures. (iv) Both also apply similar implementation-level
optimizations, representing signatures with integer ids, instead of strings, so as to reduce the
memory footprint and facilitate in-memory execution. (v) Both include character- and token-based
methods. For Blocking, the former methods mainly pertain to schema-aware techniques that apply
character-level transformations to blocking keys (e.g., q-grams, suffixes etc), while token-based
methods primarily pertain to schema-agnostic methods. For Filtering, similarity measures can also
be distinguished between character-based (e.g., edit similarity) and token-based ones (e.g., Jaccard),
even though many algorithms can be adapted to handle both. (vi) In both cases, textual data have
been combined with other types of data, particularly with spatial or spatio-temporal data, including
[110] for Blocking and [13, 19, 53, 67] for Filtering. (vii) Both can be used in real-time applications,
where the input comprises a query entity and the goal is to identify the most similar ones in the
minimum possible time. This is called Similarity Search in the case of Filtering and Real-time ER in
the case of Blocking (see Section 9 for more details).

Due to these commonalities, several works use the two frameworks interchangeably, consider-
ing Filtering as a means for Blocking (e.g., [29]). In reality, though, Blocking and Filtering have
several distinguishing characteristics: (i) By definition, a blocking scheme applies to a single entity,
considering all its attribute values (schema-agnostic methods), or combinations of multiple values
(schema-aware techniques). In contrast, Filtering usually applies to a pair of values from the same
attribute of two entities. (ii) Blocking relies on positive evidence, clustering together similar entities,
while Filtering relies on negative evidence, detecting dissimilar entities early on. (iii) Blocking is
typically independent of Entity Matching, whereas Filtering is interwoven with it, as its goal is to
optimize the execution of a matching rule. (iv) Blocking is an inherently approximate procedure that
falls short of perfect recall (PC), even when providing probabilistic guarantees (e.g., LSH Blocking
in DeepER [44]). In contrast, most Filtering methods provide an exact solution, returning all pairs

30

G. Papadakis et al.

of values that exceed the predetermined threshold along with false positives. (v) Blocking trades
slightly lower recall (PC) for much higher precision (PQ), while Filtering trades filtering power
for filtering cost. (vi) Blocking may be modelled as a learning problem, where the goal is to define
supervised blocking schemes that simultaneously optimize PC, PQ and RR, but Filtering requires
no labelled set for learning to mark a comparison as true negative. Instead, it relies on a theoretical
analysis based on the given similarity measure and threshold. (vii) Preserving privacy is orthogonal
to Filtering, with very few works examining privacy-preserving similarity joins [71, 91, 193]. In
contrast, Blocking constitutes an integral part of privacy-preserving ER, with several relevant
works (for details, refer to a recent survey [169]). (viii) Blocking constitutes an integral part of
pay-as-you-go ER applications, conveying a significant body of relevant works, as described below.
This does not apply to Filtering, given that the only relevant technique is TopkJoin [185].

Regarding the quantitative comparison between Blocking and Filtering, few works have actu-
ally examined their relative performance. The two frameworks are experimentally juxtaposed
in [157–159] in terms of effectiveness and time efficiency. Using a series of real-world datasets,
RDFKeyLearner is compared against AllPairs, PPJoin(+) and EdJoin in [157, 158] and against EdJoin,
PPJoin+ and FastJoin in [159]. All methods are fine-tuned using a sample of each dataset. The
outcomes indicate no significant difference in effectiveness, but regarding time efficiency, Filtering
is consistently faster in generating candidate matches and consistently slower in executing the
corresponding pairwise comparisons, due to their larger number. In [159], the relative scalability of
RDFKeyLearner and EdJoin is examined over synthetic datasets of 105, 2·105, ..., 106 entities. Again,
EdJoin produces more candidate matches and, thus, is slower than RDFKeyLearner.

In [86], an experimental analysis over 4 real-world datasets investigates the combined effect of
Blocking and Filtering on ER efficiency, implementing the workflow in Figure 1(b). The results
suggest that together, the two frameworks reduce the overall ER running time from 33% to 76%,
with an average of 50%. However, only one method per framework is considered: the manually
fine-tuned SB and PPJoin in combination with Cosine and Jaccard similarity. Note that, due to its
careful, manual fine-tuning, Blocking has no impact on ER effectiveness.

However, more experimental analyses are required for drawing safe conclusions about the relative
performance of Blocking and Filtering. These analyses should include a large, representative variety
of techniques per framework along with several established benchmark datasets and should examine
the benefits of combining the two frameworks in more depth.

8 BLOCKING AND FILTERING IN ENTITY RESOLUTION SYSTEMS
We now present the main systems that address ER, examining whether they incorporate any of the
aforementioned methods to improve the runtime and the scalability of their workflows. We analyti-
cally examined the 18 non-commercial and 15 commercial systems listed in the extended version
of [84]1 along with the 10 Link Discovery frameworks surveyed in [109]. Table 3 summarizes the
characteristics of 12 open-source ER systems that include at least one Blocking or Filtering method.
Half of the tools offer a graphical user interface and are implemented in Java. Regarding the
type of the input data, most systems support structured data. The only exceptions are the three
Link Discovery frameworks, which are crafted for semi-structured data. JedAI is the only tool that
applies uniformly to both structured and semi-structured data.

We also observe that all systems include Blocking methods, with Standard Blocking (SB) and
Sorted Neighborhood (SN) being the most popular ones. The first four systems are Link Discovery
frameworks that implement custom approaches: KnoFuss and SERIMI apply Token Blocking only
to the literal values of RDF tiples, while Silk and LIMES implement hybrid methods, MultiBlock

and LIMES, respectively (see Section 6). Febrl and JedAI offer the largest variety of established
techniques. The former provides their original, schema-aware implementation, while the latter
provides their schema-agnostic adaptations. For this reason, JedAI is the only tool that implements
Block Processing techniques, as well.

Note that Block Building is also a core part of the ER workflow in several commercial systems, such
as IBM Infosphere and Informatica Data Quality [84]. These systems are generally required to handle
diverse types of data, focusing on data exploration and cleaning. They typically provide variations
of SB, allowing users to extract blocking keys from specific attributes through a sophisticated GUI
that provides statistics and data analysis. As a result, users’ expertise and experience with specific
domains is critical for the performance of these systems’ blocking components.

Surprisingly, only two systems currently include Filtering algorithms for improving the runtime
of their matching process: LIMES and Magellan. The latter actually offers the largest variety of
established techniques through the py_stringsimjoin package. Filtering techniques are also
provided by FEVER [85], which is a closed-source ER tool, as well as by JedAI’s forthcoming version
3. Still, a mere minority of ER tools enables users to combine the benefits of Blocking and Filtering,
despite the promising potential of their synergy (see below for more details). Most importantly,
these tools exclusively consider traditional Filtering algorithms that apply to the values of individual
attributes. Hence, they disregard the recent Filtering techniques for Complex Matching (cf. Section
5.3), which are more suitable for Entity Resolution. Therefore, more effort should be devoted on
developing ER tools that make the most of the synergy between Blocking and Filtering.

It is worth noting that Filtering plays an important role in modern systems. For example, Corleone
[57] introduced a novel filtering approach that leverages machine learning: active learning is used
to minimize the number of examples labeled by users, and then, random forests are trained to learn
the matching rules that will be used in filtering. The resulting robust model is scaled by Falcon [32],
while CloudMatcher [60] provides an end-to-end implementation based on this approach. These
systems have been successfully applied to real-world domains [59].

9 FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Various directions seem promising for future work, from entity evolution [119] to deep learning
[44] and summarization algorithms [73], which minimize the memory footprint of blocks, while
accelerating their processing. The following are more mature fields, having assembled a critical
mass of methods already.

Progressive Entity Resolution. Due to the constant increase of data volumes, new progressive
or pay-as-you-go ER applications have emerged. Their goal is to provide the best possible partial
solution within a limited budget of temporal or computational resources. In such applications,
Blocking lays the ground for Prioritization, which schedules the processing of entities, comparisons
or blocks according to the likelihood that they involve duplicates. We distinguish the relevant
techniques into schema-aware and schema-agnostic ones.

The schema-aware progressive methods require domain knowledge [134, 182]. Progressive Sorted
Neighborhood (PSN) [182] uses schema-based SN to create a sorted list of entities and then applies
an incremental window size w. Starting from the top of the list, all entities in consecutive positions
(w=1) are compared; then, all entities at distance w=2 are compared and so on and so forth, until
reaching the user-defined budget. Dynamic PSN [134] extends this static approach by adjusting the
processing order of comparisons on-the-fly, according to the results of a perfect matcher. It arranges
the sorted entities in a two-dimensional array A, and if A(i, j) corresponds to a pair of duplicates, the
processing moves on to check A(i + 1, j) and A(i, j + 1), as well. Progressive Blocking [134] generalizes
this principle to SB. Hierarchy of Record Partitions [182] creates a static hierarchy of blocks, where
the matching likelihood of two entities is proportional to the level in which they co-occur for
the first time. This hierarchy is then progressively resolved, level by level, from leaves to root. A
variation of this approach is adapted to MapReduce in [6], while the Ordered List of Records [182]
converts it into a list of entities that are sorted by their likelihood to produce matches. A progressive
solution for relational Multi-source ER over different entity types is proposed in [5]. Finally, P-RDS
adapts LSH-based blocking to a progressive functionality by rearranging the processing order of its
hash tables according to the number of matching and unnecessary comparisons in their buckets
that have been resolved so far.

The schema-agnostic methods, which disregard any domain knowledge, are classified into two
types [156]: (i) The sort-based methods order all entities alphabetically, according to their attribute
value tokens, leveraging schema-agnostic SN. Local Schema-agnostic Progressive SN [156] slides
an incremental window over the sorted list of entities and, for each window size, it orders the
non-redundant comparisons according to the co-occurrence frequency of their entities and the
number of blocking keys per entity. Global Schema-agnostic Progressive SN [156] does the same,
but for a predetermined range of windows, eliminating all redundant comparisons they contain. (ii)
The hash-based methods leverage the blocking graph for Prioritization. Progressive Block Scheduling
[156] orders the blocks in ascending number of comparisons and then prioritizes all comparisons
per block in decreasing edge weight. Progressive Profile Scheduling [156] orders entities in decreasing
average edge weight and then prioritizes all comparisons per entity in decreasing edge weight.

The schema-agnostic methods excel in recall and precision [156], but exclusively support static
prioritization, defining an immutable processing order that disregards the detection of duplicates.
Hence, more research is needed for developing dynamic schema-agnostic progressive methods.

Real-time Entity Resolution. This is the task of matching an entity that is given as query
to the available entity collections in (ideally) sub-second run-time. To meet this goal, several
specialized dynamic indexing techniques have been proposed in the literature. An early approach
is presented in [26]. The core idea is to pre-calculate similarities between the attribute values of
entities co-occurring in the blocks of Standard Blocking, thus avoiding similarity calculations at

query time. Three indexes are created for this purpose, containing all the necessary information.
This approach is extended by DySimII [142] so that all three indexes are updated as query entities
arrive. The experimental results demonstrate that both the average record insertion time and the
average query time remain practically stable, even when the index size grows.

Another family of relevant techniques extends SN. F-DySNI [139, 141] converts the sorted list
of blocking keys into an index that is faster to search: it creates a braided AVL tree [145] that
combines a height balanced binary tree with a double-linked list, where every node is linked to
its alphabetically sorted predecessor node, to its successor node and to the ids of all entities that
correspond to its blocking key. There is one tree for each blocking key definition that gets updated
whenever a query entity arrives. The window is fixed or adaptive, considering as neighbors the
nodes that exceed a specific similarity threshold. F-DySNI is extended in [140] with an automatic
approach for selecting blocking keys; the weak training set of [76] is coupled with a scoring function
that assesses the coverage of each key along with the distribution of its block sizes.

Another group of methods relies on LSH. MinHash LSH is combined with SN in [92]: when
searching for the nearest neighbors of a query entity, the entities in large LSH blocks are sorted via
a custom scoring function and, then, a window of fixed size slides over the sorted list of entities.
CF-RDS [72] leverages Hamming LSH, ranking the most similar entities to each query without
performing any profile comparison. Instead, it merely aggregates the number of occurrences of
each candidate match in the buckets associated with the query entity.

On another line of research, BlockSketch [73] organizes the entities inside every block into
sub-blocks according to their similarity. A representative is assigned to each sub-block based on its
distance from the corresponding blocking key. In this way, every query suffices to be compared
with a constant number of entities in the target block in order to detect its most similar entities.
SBlockSketch [73] adapts this approach to a stream of query entities through an eviction strategy
that bounds the number of blocks that need to be maintained in memory.

All these methods are crafted for structured data, assuming a fixed schema of known quality.
New techniques are required, though, for the noisy, heterogeneous entities of semi-structured data.
Parameter Configuration. Except TB, all Blocking methods involve at least one internal param-
eter that affects their performance to a large extent [25, 132]. This affects their relative performance,
rendering the selection of the best performing method for the data at hand into a non-trivial task.
To mitigate this issue, parameter fine-tuning is modelled as an optimization problem in [100]. The
large, heterogeneous space of possible configurations is searched through a genetic algorithm, whose
fitness function exploits the labels (i.e., match vs non-match) of part of the candidate matches. After
applying the typical series of genetic operators, (i.e., mutation, crossover, elite capture and parental
selection) is applied for a specific number of generations, the configuration maximizing the fitness
function is selected as optimal. However, this approach involves a large number of parameters itself.
In another direction, MatchCatcher [90] implements a human-in-the-loop approach combining
expert knowledge with labelled instances in order to learn composite blocking schemes. Using
string similarity joins, duplicates sharing no block are efficiently detected. To capture them, the
expert user adapts the transformation and assignment functions iteratively. Finally, a methodâĂŹs
performance over several labelled datasets is used for fine-tuning its parameters over a given
unlabelled dataset in [114]. At its core lies a two-dimensional metric space formed by the overall
running time and F-Measure (horizontal and vertical axis, respectively). The closer a method is
mapped to the ideal point (0,1), the better is its performance. A graph is then built such that every
node corresponds to a different configuration or blocking method, while a directed edge points
from node ni to nj if nj is closer to (0,1). The node with no outgoing edges or the largest difference
between incoming and outgoing edges corresponds to the best choice. However, this is a rather
time-consuming approach, given the large number of computations it requires.

G. Papadakis et al.

None of the above methods satisfies the requirement for automatic, data-driven, a-priori parame-

ter configuration of Blocking methods, which thus remains an open problem.

Filtering for Entity Resolution. We believe that more opportunities exist for transferring
ideas and approaches between Blocking and Filtering. Another interesting direction is to investigate
in practical settings to what extent similarity joins suffice for ER, i.e., representing entity profiles
by strings or sets and defining a matching function based on a similarity threshold. We expect
that techniques supporting relaxed matching criteria and/or lower similarity thresholds will be
required to achieve high recall. Yet, as explained in Section 5.3, relatively few Filtering techniques
are designed for these cases. Moreover, scalability remains an open challenge for string and set
similarity joins, as shown in [51]. Finally, there is a need for extensible, open-source ER tools that
incorporate the majority of established Blocking and Filtering methods and apply seamlessly to
structured, semi-structured and unstructured data [58].

10 CONCLUSIONS
Efficiency techniques are an integral part of Entity Resolution, since its infancy. We organize the
relevant works into Blocking, Filtering and hybrid techniques, facilitating their understanding
and use. We also provide an in-depth coverage of each category, further classifying its works into
novel sub-categories. Lately, the rise of big semi-structured data poses challenges to the scalability
of efficiency techniques and to their core assumptions: the requirement of Blocking for schema
knowledge and of Filtering for high similarity thresholds. The former led to the introduction of
schema-agnostic Blocking and of Block Processing techniques, while the latter led to more relaxed
criteria of similarity. We cover these new fields in detail, putting in context all relevant works.
