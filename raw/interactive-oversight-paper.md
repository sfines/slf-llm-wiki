## Abstract

As Large Language Models increasingly automate complex, long-horizon tasks such as \emph{vibe coding}, a supervision gap has emerged. While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54\% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.

As Large Language Models increasingly automate complex, long-horizon tasks such as vibe coding,
a supervision gap has emerged. While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them
effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the
inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight:
enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify
or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes
complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather
than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and
recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development
task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents,
achieving a 54% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be
optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway
for maintaining human control as AI scales.

1. Introduction

Rapid progress in Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning and long-horizon planning has empowered models
to tackle increasingly complex tasks with longer decision chains (Cai et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025). A salient
example is vibe coding, where users describe high-level software requirements in natural language, and the AI
handles the implementation (Ge et al., 2025; Karpathy, 2025). This paradigm effectively lowers the barrier for
non-experts to build sophisticated software (Treude and Gerosa, 2025).

However, this shift introduces an asymmetry: the model becomes a strong executor, while the human is
relegated to a comparatively weak supervisory role (Burns et al., 2023). Crucially, this weakness is situational
rather than just competence-based: users are constrained not only by insufficient domain expertise but also by
the prohibitive time and cognitive effort required to precisely articulate intent. This limitation creates two
bottlenecks. First, the specification gap: users often provide underspecified instructions, either because they
lack the knowledge to identify constraints or simply cannot afford the bandwidth to detail them exhaustively
(Ge et al., 2025; Hadfield-Menell et al., 2017; Ray, 2025). Second, the verification gap: as models autonomously
execute long-horizon tasks, the complexity of their outputs often exceeds the user’s capacity to efficiently
validate them (Wu et al., 2021; Xi et al., 2025).

These challenges highlight a fundamental scalable oversight problem: enabling humans to steer capabilities
that exceed their own (OpenAI, 2023). While approaches like AI critique (Saunders et al., 2022) and debate
(Irving et al., 2018) help verify outputs, they largely rely on post-hoc evaluation. This is inefficient for long-
horizon generation (Wu et al., 2021), where ambiguity needs to be resolved early to prevent the model from
committing to a misaligned trajectory that is costly to reverse. Crucially, existing methods lack a pre-execution
interaction layer (Deng et al., 2024; Sun et al., 2025). They fail to help users elicit and structure their intent
before the model acts, creating a gap in translating vague requirements into precise, verifiable specifications.

To bridge this gap, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that amplifies human supervision
by decomposing complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions. Rather than relying on open-ended
prompting, our system functions as an interactive agent that guides the user through a structured elicitation
process (Figure 1). At each node of the decomposition tree, the user provides low-burden feedback—selecting

Steering LLMs via Scalable Interactive Oversight

Figure 1 | Motivation: As AI increasingly surpasses humans in solving complex problems, people often delegate
tasks such as software development to AI using only natural language instructions. However, misalignment
arises in such collaboration. This is because humans become weak supervisors; they struggle to provide feedback
on large outputs and challenging tasks. To tackle this, we propose a Framework: We decompose the task
into a structured tree T 𝑡. After the interaction at node 𝑣𝑡, the user preference is accumulated to update T 𝑡 to
T 𝑡+1. So the interaction afterwards will be more aligned with the user. The system loops until all nodes are
completed.

or critiquing options—without needing to handle the full complexity of the output. This recursive interaction
allows the agent to iteratively “decode" vague user intent into precise, expert-level specifications, effectively
steering the global behavior of the model before execution begins.

We validate our approach using the “sandwich” protocol (Bowman et al., 2022), a rigorous evaluation
setting where a non-expert user attempts to guide a strong model to achieve tasks that only an expert can
verify. Focusing on full-stack website development as a benchmark, we assess whether non-experts can produce
professional-grade Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) that match real-world complexity. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both standard vibe coding baselines (e.g., Claude
Code, Gemini CLI) and vanilla interaction methods, improving alignment scores by up to 54%. Furthermore,
we show that this interaction process is not just for inference; it generates high-quality supervision signals
that can be used to optimize the model via Reinforcement Learning (RL), enabling the system to improve its
questioning and alignment strategies from online user feedback.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

• Problem Formalization: We characterize the asymmetry between weak human supervision and strong
model execution in current complex tasks, and formulate it as a concrete scalable oversight problem.
• Scalable Interactive Oversight: We propose an agentic framework that decomposes complex intent into
a recursive tree of low-burden decisions. This mechanism empowers non-experts to proactively steer
models toward professional-grade outcomes.

• Learning from Interactive Supervision: We demonstrate that our interaction signals serve as effective
rewards for reinforcement learning. We validate that the framework can be jointly optimized via online
user feedback and outcome-based verification.

2. Preliminary & Problem Setup

We aim to develop a method that can help non-expert users steer strong LLMs and achieve professional results
aligned with their true intent. Evaluating alignment is difficult because the human intention remains latent. In
this section, we detail our research setup, which operationalizes the theoretical “sandwich” protocol to enable
rigorous evaluation.

2.1. Preliminary: The “Sandwich" Protocol

Sandwiching experiments pose an empirical test of a scalable oversight technique’s ability to align a model
(Bowman et al., 2022; Cotra, 2021). There are three roles: (1) The non-expert, who has intentions but is a weak
supervisor. They cannot perform the task or oversee a model without assistance. (2) The model sandwiched
between, which has sufficient capability to perform the task, but may not be aligned. (3) The expert, who has
all the capabilities to reliably evaluate the output. The expert provides a good-faith evaluation signal without
performing the task, serving as an approximate upper bound on achievable alignment under correct supervision.
During the experiment, the non-expert uses a scalable oversight technique to supervise the model. The effect of
the scalable oversight method can be measured by the gap in alignment achieved under non-expert supervision
versus expert supervision.

2.2. Problem Setup

We consider a scalable oversight setting in which a non-expert user seeks to align a strong language model
with their latent intent, despite being unable to fully specify or verify the desired outcome. We situate the
problem in the context of vibe coding, where users express software requirements in natural language and the
system autonomously produces development artifacts. Directly evaluating alignment at the level of a complete
software system is costly and capability-intensive: reviewing large codebases requires substantial expertise and
is easily confounded by code-level implementation issues rather than requirement misalignment. Instead, we
adopt the Product Requirements Document (PRD) as an evaluation pivot: a PRD captures the requirements
while being substantially easier to assess than the final implementation itself (Jackson, 2012; Wiegers and
Beatty, 2013). Alignment is therefore evaluated by how well the PRD generated by the model reflects the
user’s underlying intent. To enable rigorous evaluation, we instantiate the Sandwich Protocol under our setting:

• The weak human (non-expert): The user H cannot fully specify their intent or reliably verify execution
outcomes due to limited cognitive bandwidth or insufficient software development expertise. As a result,
H can only provide an initial, high-level query 𝑞, even though the user has an underlying intent I that
constitutes the target of alignment.

• The model to supervise: The model generates a PRD D∗ in response to the user’s query. While it is
capable of producing a complete PRD, its output may deviate from the user’s true intent I in the absence
of effective supervision.

• Expert evaluator. The expert does not participate in the generation process. Instead, the expert evaluates
the degree of alignment between the final document D∗ and the targeted user intent I. Consistent with
the Sandwich Protocol, this assessment serves as an approximate upper bound of correct supervision,
considering the intent as the observable “golden standard".

Under this setup, our research objective is to develop scalable oversight methods that enable alignment
achieved under weak human supervision to approach that achievable expert-level supervision. Concretely, we
measure how closely the output D∗ approaches the target intent I according to expert evaluation, and treat
this as an indicator of how effectively weak human supervision is amplified.

3. Method: Scalable Interactive Oversight

In this section, we introduce an interaction agent that provides scalable oversight throughout the interaction
process. It works in a decomposition-interaction loop:

3

Steering LLMs via Scalable Interactive Oversight

Algorithm 1 Interactive Requirement Elicitation
1: Input: User 𝐻 with implicit requirement I and query 𝑞, interaction policy 𝜋interaction
2: Output: Product Requirement Document D∗
3: Initialize requirement tree T (0) ← InitializeTree(𝑞)
4: Initialize context M ← ∅, 𝑡 ← 0
5: while T (𝑡) contains unresolved nodes do
𝑣𝑡 ← Depth-first traversal(T (𝑡) )
6:
P𝑡 ← Interact( 𝐻 (I), 𝜋interaction, 𝑣𝑡, M)
7:
8: M ← UpdateContext(M, 𝑣𝑡, P𝑡)
𝑡 ← 𝑡 + 1
9:
10: end while
11: D∗ ← GeneratePRD(T (𝑡) , M)
12: return D∗

Decomposition initializing: Given a natural language instruction 𝑞 by a human, the agent first decomposes the
incoming long-horizon task into a tree-structured interaction plan T 0. In the context of web-dev requirements,
the leaf nodes correspond to concrete development modules (e.g., parent: UI design; child: display rule).

Interacting at node-level: At this stage, the user provides supervision. For each leaf node 𝑣𝑡, the agent engages
the user through low-burden queries tailored to the current subtask, and the user makes feedback based on the
intentions ( 1O in Figure 1). Specifically, we constrain the interaction questions in a closed form (primarily issues
selection-based or ranking-based queries). Users may also respond with DontCare (outside their concern) or
DontKnow (beyond their understanding), allowing the interaction to adapt.

Updating the task-decomposition: After completing the interaction for a leaf node, the agent summarizes
the elicited feedback into a compact node preference P𝑡 and adds it to a cumulative preference state ( 2O
in Figure 1). Then the agent updates the interaction plan conditioned on the cumulative preference state
(T 𝑡 → T (𝑡+1) , 3O in Figure 1), allowing future interactions to be adaptively shaped by previously expressed
user intent.

This loop continues until all nodes are visited. At termination, the interaction agent is considered to have
fully accumulated the user’s preferences, producing a global preference state that can be input to downstream
generation. Algorithm 1 formalizes this interaction. All of the prompts we used in the workflow are presented
in Appendix C. We illustrate interaction cases in Appendix B.4.

This design adopts three mechanisms for scalable oversight:

• Simplifying supervision. First, users are only required to provide selection or ranking feedback, rather
than fully specifying requirements in natural language. Because comparative judgments impose lower
cognitive demands than requirement specification (Radhakrishnan et al., 2023), this design makes
supervision easier for users.

• Amplifying supervision signal. The interaction agent recursively amplifies weak supervision signals by
accumulating user preferences across the interaction tree. This is inspired by the previous scalable oversight
methods (Christiano et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2021). Through this recursive preference propagation, the
human feedback can be transformed into increasingly strong supervision as interactions increase, enabling
more effective alignment. Second, by decomposing a complex task into a tree of localized subtasks, the
system relieves users from managing a large global scope. As a result, non-expert users can provide
supervision without needing a holistic understanding of the entire scope.

• Scaling interaction. The tree-based architecture inherently supports interactions of arbitrary depth,
offering a scalable path toward aligning increasingly complex systems. As long as the user’s cognitive
load permits, the tree can be expanded indefinitely to facilitate human-AI collaboration on increasingly
sophisticated tasks.

4. Empirical Validation of Scalable Interactive Oversight Framework at Test Time

4.1. Setup

Task and Dataset. We focus on enabling non-expert users to produce professional website development
requirements that align with their true intent. To operationalize this evaluation objective, we construct PRDs
based on real-world websites and regard them as the true intent I for the users. Specifically, we crawl production
websites to collect their complete UI components, and use search-augmented LLM to gather additional publicly
available information, such as related GitHub repositories and other functional descriptions. Using the detailed
function description and UI components. Then we use LLMs to generate a structured PRD for each website,
omitting low-level technical details to better reflect non-expert requirements. Following established practices in
software engineering (Wiegers and Beatty, 2013), we structure all PRDs into five modules: product overview, core
function, non-functional requirements, business rules, and user experience design. See PRD cases in Appendix B.3.
We then synthesize an initial user request 𝑞 (e.g., “I want to build a recipe-sharing platform”) that a
non-expert might plausibly provide during vibe coding. The initial requirement tree T 0 is generated from 𝑞
with the five root nodes. We sample 37 test cases for the test time validation.

Evaluation settings. Following the “sandwich" setting in Section 2, we evaluate the similarity between the
generated D∗ and the target intent I using a rubric-based evaluation. Each I is decomposed into atomic
requirements R = {𝑟1, . . . , 𝑟𝑚} (e.g., “user authentication methods”, “responsive design”), and we compute the
Alignment Score as follows:

Alignment Score(D∗) =

1

|R|

∑︁

𝑟𝑖 ∈ R

𝕀[𝑟𝑖 satisfied in D∗]

In large scale evaluation, we applied LLM-judge based on Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct. We provide LLM-
judge details and its validation in Appendix A.2.

User simulation. To scale our experiments, we develop a user simulator H (I, 𝑞) that emulates non-expert user
behavior during interaction. Conditioned on the ground-truth intent I, the initial query 𝑞, and a non-expert
role specification, the simulator interacts with the system and provides feedback throughout the workflow. We
implement the simulator with deepseek-R1, chosen for its strong role-playing capability. We validate the
simulation against a test set of real user interactions to ensure fidelity. More details about user simulation are
in Appendix A.3.

Baselines. We compare our method against two baselines: (1) Direct PRD generation with popular vibe coding
framework without interaction, e.g., codex, claude-code, gemini-cli. (2) Vanilla interaction: vanilla
multi-turn free-form dialogue to generate a PRD. We use GPT-5, claude-sonnet-4.5, and gemini2.5-pro
as the PRD generator, i.e., the strong but maybe misaligned model under the “sandwich" setting. For the
interaction model in vanilla interaction and ours, we use the corresponding model to interact with the users as
well as the tree updating (except for the gemini experiment, because it doesn’t adhere well to JSON format
tree structures, so we used o4-mini for tree structure updates. Results in Section 4.3 shows that this didn’t
significantly affect the results). Details baseline settings are in Appendix A.1.

4.2. Results

Table 1 presents results on simulated users across PRD modules. Module-level scores are the fraction of
satisfied rubrics per module, and the overall score is the fraction satisfied across all modules. Our method
exhibit remarkable improvement over the baselines on the alignment metric. Both popular vibe coding
frameworks and vanilla interaction struggle to capture nuanced user intent in comprehensive PRDs. On GPT-5,
we achieves substantial improvements of 33% and 39% over vanilla interaction and codex, respectively. On
claude-sonnet-4.5, we achieve 0.618 on average, consistently outperforming both vanilla interaction and
claude code. Notably, the improvement is also pronounced on Gemini-2.5-pro: our framework increases
the average score from 0.359 (vanilla interaction) to 0.554, corresponding to a +54% relative gain.

measured from intermediate documents generated with cumulative
preferences with GPT-5 as interaction agents (Left: simulated user;
Right: human user).

Figure 3 | Results of ablation study. We
test on the fisrt 2 modules with GPT-5 as
the interacton model.

Across modules, the largest and most consistent gains appear on Module 2 (core function), which most
directly reflects users’ core needs (e.g., +0.24 on GPT-5 vs. codex, +0.15 on gemini-2.5-pro over vanilla
interaction). Modules 3–5 generally exhibit lower across methods, likely because user intent is harder to infer
at these stages. Our approach mitigates this difficulty and improves late-stage performance, achieving up to
+0.21 on Module 5. Overall, Ours improves average performance while demonstrating sustained alignment as
interaction progresses and preferences accumulate.

The performance scales with interaction. The tree-structured decomposition provides scalability for our
framework. To evaluate whether scaling interaction boosts the performance, we generate an intermediate PRD
based on the accumulated preferences and evaluate its alignment with the oriented one every 5 interaction
nodes. Figure 2(left) illustrates the alignment score evolution on GPT-5. The improvement in alignment with
the increasing number of interaction nodes indicates that our method has good scalability in future applications.

The improvements also exhibit in to final
web implementations. From requirement doc-
uments generated by the no-interaction baseline
and our method, we generate corresponding full-
stack websites using claude-opus-4.5 under
the claude code framework, and evaluate their
alignment with the same evaluation method. We
evaluate the alignment of the resulting implementations using the same rubric-based evaluation as in the
PRD-level assessment, with claude-opus-4.5 acting as the LLM judge under the claude code framework
as well. We additionally ask human judges to score successfully deployable implementations. The results are
reported in Table 2. Our method consistently outperforms the baseline under both LLM-based and human
evaluation, indicating improved alignment. We show some examples of the deployed website in Appendix B.2.

Figure 4 | Case Study. Left: Tree nodes are evolved with the preference elicited. Middle: The system amplifies
the preference but prevents the ambiguity amplification. Right: The output could balance between non-expert
perference with expertise.

Qualitative analysis. Partial execution traces of our framework are shown in Figure 4 (see Appendix B.4
for detailed examples). The cases indicate the three fact: (1) User preferences directly dictate the dynamic
reconfiguration of the tree structure; (2) When facing the ambiguous or uncertain user inputs the system
proactively initiates clarification cycles and adjusts the interaction strategy to ensure data integrity; (3) When
aligning users, the system ensures that the proposed options meet the requirements of advancement.

4.3. Ablation Study

Using the vanilla multi-turn interaction as a baseline, we analyze the incremental impact of our proposed
components on the first two modules(Figure 3):

• Easy supervision: We first evaluate the effect of providing interaction policy that ease the feedback
by removing the tree-based preference propagation. The results show moderate gains (e.g., a 4.7%
improvement in Module 2), indicating that constraining user feedback into closed formats helps reliable
feedback.

• Tree-based preference propagation: To isolate the system effects from model capacity, we replace the
full controller with a lightweight model (o4-mini) for tree updates. Even this lightweight variant yields
a substantial gain (e.g., +11.7% on Module 2), indicating that explicit interaction state management and
preference propagation play an important role beyond controller model scaling.

4.4. Real-user Study on Alignment Effectiveness

We hired a non-expert to engage in our interaction system. The user is required to collaborate with the GPT-5
based on the given requirements, to generate professional-level documents. Due to the resource limit, we
conduct the experiments on 10 cases. The results also indicate the trend: The more interaction, the more
aligned. For every three interaction nodes, we use the accumulated preference to generate the document with
GPT-5. The results is illustrated in Figure 2(right), exhibiting the increase in alignment scores as interaction
rounds progress. And the user reported that: It enables detailed and in-depth control. There are detailed
real-user interaction cases in Appendix B.1.

5. Training Interactive Agents with RL from Online Human Feedback

Although RLHF (Ouyang et al., 2022) is a common technique for improving model alignment, it still relies on
comparing or rating outputs (Wang et al., 2024; Zhou et al., 2024). In software development tasks, this is hard
for non-expert users. In this section, we validate that we can directly use online feedback signals from weak
supervisors to optimize the interaction agent. An external evaluator could further provide effective reward
signals.

5.1. Reinforcement Learning Setup & Formalization

Training rollout. Given query 𝑞 𝑗, at node 𝑣1, the policy 𝜋interaction interacts with simulated user H (I𝑗, 𝑞 𝑗) to
produce 𝑆 𝑗,1. Then 𝜋interaction updates M with node preference, select next node, obtain 𝑆 𝑗,2. Iterate until
. Because traces are multi-turn and do not share prefixes, each input
all nodes are resolved to yield PRD 𝐷∗
𝑗
typically produces multiple training sequences (see Figure 5, left).

Training settings. We trained a Qwen3-30B-A3B model as the initial policy. We use gemini-2.5-pro as the
doc generator and use o4-mini to update the requirement tree for the rollout. For the advantage calculating,
we use a variant to GRPO algorithm (Shao et al., 2024). Detailed training settings and parameter comparison
experiments are presented in Appendix A.4.

5.2. Online Reward from Weak-supervisor

Reward design. We first focus on whether we can rely entirely on weak supervision signals from users to align
the model. Therefore, we design a User Reward (UR): for each trainable interaction sequence 𝑆 𝑗,𝑖, we count the
proportion of DontCare responses from the user as a penalty reward. Formally:

𝑈𝑅(𝑆 𝑗,𝑖) = −

(cid:205)|𝑆 𝑗,𝑖 |

𝑡=1 𝕀[ 𝑓 𝑡 = DontCare]
|𝑆 𝑗,𝑖|

This reward encourages the model to minimize the frequency of DontCare responses, thereby promoting more
effective and engaging interactions that better capture user intent. Notably, this reward is purely online.

Result. The interaction could be optimized with the signal from the non-expert user only, as Figure 6(left)
shows. With the training reward increase over steps, which means the ratio that the user expresses DontCare
decreases, the alignment score also increases. This result is exciting because it demonstrates a weak-to-strong
optimization effect, where non-experts’ feedback at interaction time is sufficient to guide stronger models.
From another perspective, this makes online training possible because the reward is online.

5.3. Combining Reward from Expert Evaluator

Reward design. Further, we incorporate an Expert Reward based on the evaluation of generated PRDs. A
direct reward is Outcome Reward (OR), using the alignment score between generated PRD 𝐷∗
and oriented
𝑗
intent I. Each 𝑆 𝑗,_ could share the same outcome reward. Considering the scarcity of final reward, we also
design Progressive Reward(PR) to evaluate node-level interaction gain. At each node 𝑣𝑖, there is accumulated
preference conclusions P1
. The 𝑃𝑅 𝑗,𝑖 evaluates whether the existence of P 𝑖
𝑗
could make progress in the alignment between accumulated preferences and the oriented I𝑗. The llm judge
prompt of the progressive reward is presented in Appendix C.7. In optimization, we use the reward as their
combination for the 𝑗𝑡ℎ sample in the batch:

Figure 6 | RL training dynamics. This curve is based on the same agent configuration as the rl training. The
alignment score is calculated based on performance on Modules 1 and 2, which are the modules used during
training, and we report the average across three test runs. Both the online reward and the combination of
outcome reward make the system better. The latter reached higher.

Result. The combination of the reward from both the user and expert further enhances the optimization as
the Figure 6 shows. This reward makes the system achieve a higher alignment score. However, the online
reward makes the training dynamic stabler. In Appendix A.4, we present the ablation study of the reward
design, which indicates that all of the rewards could boost the RL training.

5.4. RL Enhances Generalization and Efficiency

Both reward designs exhibit generalization to untrained modules and unseen test settings. The RL
training is conducted within Module 1 and Module 2. During the test time, we use the best-performance
models to conduct full interaction both under the RL training settings and GPT-5 setting. The results are
shown in Table 3, although M3–M5 are not included during RL training, both “User Reward" and “User+Expert
Reward" setting show improved performance on these untrained modules. Under the same-as-training setting,
“User+Expert Reward" improves the average score on M3–M5 from 0.500 to 0.518. This trend is further amplified
under the GPT-5 setting, where the average score on the untrained module increases from 0.606 to 0.640.

RL improves interaction efficiency. We
visualize the change in the number of
interaction nodes over the course of RL
training in Figure 7. No matter whether
measured by the total number of inter-
action rounds (left) or the number of in-
teraction rounds per node (right), both
metrics exhibit a clear downward trend,
indicating that RL training enables the
model to conduct more effective interac-
tions and acquire information with higher
efficiency.

turns. Right: average turns per node. Interaction turns decrease
over training, indicating improved interaction efficiency.

6. Related Work

Scalable oversight. Superalignment emphasizes the need to steer and control AI systems that are much more
capable than humans (OpenAI, 2023). Scalable oversight addresses this challenge by reframing supervision as
an easier task, enabling humans to oversee models beyond their direct capabilities. Prior work has explored
several scalable oversight paradigms, including AI critique (Bai et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023; McAleese et al.,
2024; Saunders et al., 2022; Xi et al., 2024), where auxiliary models evaluate or verify outputs; amplification,
which decomposes complex tasks into simpler subproblems (Christiano et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2021); and debate,
which surfaces errors and misalignment by eliciting competing arguments for human judgment (Irving et al.,
2018). ‘Sandwiching’ framework is proposed to measure the effectiveness of an alignment method (Bowman
et al., 2022; Cotra, 2021). However, most of these paradigms primarily focus on evaluating, decomposing, or
contesting model outputs, rather than shaping user intent before execution. We bridge this gap by implementing
a practical interactive framework that enables non-experts to effectively align AI agents.

Vibe coding. The rapid evolution of large language models has transformed the role of AI in software
engineering from a passive code-writing aid into an active, agentic collaborator (Anthropic, 2025; Google,
2025; OpenAI, 2025). This transformation has introduced an emergent development approach - often referred
to as Vibe Coding- in which programmers rely on behavioral validation of AI-produced systems, emphasizing
empirical outcomes over direct examination of the underlying source code (Ge et al., 2025; Horvat, 2025;
Karpathy, 2025; Ray, 2025). However, this new paradigm presents reliability challenges. Quantitative research
shows that collaborating with code agents unexpectedly increases the task-completion time for 19% (Becker
et al., 2025). The limitation of natural language in expressing complex development requirements has exposed
(Schmidt et al., 2024; Treude and Gerosa, 2025).

7. Conclusion & Future Work

In this paper, we first observe that as models increasingly replace humans in performing complex tasks, the
relationship between humans and models is gradually shifting toward one between weak supervisors and
strong executors. Motivated by this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight under which non-expert humans
can effectively steer LLMs to produce expert-level and aligned outputs. We evaluate on website requirement
generation task, where our method significantly improves the alignment over baselines. Furthermore, we train
the interaction agent using reinforcement learning and find that online supervision signals from non-expert
humans alone are sufficient to improve system alignment, while incorporating training signals from expert
evaluators can further enhance performance.

Several open directions remain for future work. First, the interaction efficiency could be further improved
through specific UI design, as our current selection- and ranking-based interactions can be completed via simple
screen clicks rather than text entry. Second, broader real-user evaluations would be valuable for assessing
understanding inter-user variance in supervision quality and interaction behavior. Third, jointly training the
tree updater may further improve preference propagation in complex tasks.

Figure 8 | A conceptual waterfall model (Wiegers and Beatty, 2013) in Vibe coding. The interaction agent
serves as a glue layer between users and code agents, enabling scalable oversight of code generation from
non-expert supervision.

Finally, our work focuses on requirement-level oversight and does not fully study code-level supervision.
As future work, the interaction agent could act as a proxy for user intent after a requirement document is
established, supervising downstream coding agents by routing incorrect code to a development loop, and
over-specified implementations back to requirement refinement, forming a waterfall-style process (Wiegers and
Beatty, 2013). We illustrate this relationship in Figure 8, and hope to validate this paradigm for end-to-end
software delivery in future.

Impact Statement

This work studies interactive alignment in settings where strong language models are guided by non-expert
users over extended interactions, a scenario that is increasingly common in agentic and autonomous AI systems.
As models take on more complex tasks, human users often function as weak supervisors, making it difficult to
reliably convey intent through single-shot or unstructured feedback.

By explicitly structuring interaction and accumulating user preferences over time, our approach enables
non-expert users to more reliably steer strong models toward outcomes aligned with their intent. This can
reduce reliance on expert supervision, lower the barrier to deploying AI systems in complex domains, and
improve robustness in long-horizon tasks where direct human oversight is inherently limited.

A potential risk of this approach is that accumulated preferences may amplify early misunderstandings or
biases in user intent, leading the system to converge on an incorrect objective in a stable but undesirable way.
Moreover, the framework is not intended for safety-critical domains where stronger guarantees and expert
oversight are required.

These considerations underscore the importance of transparent interaction design and appropriate deploy-
ment safeguards. We view this work as a step toward improving controllability and alignment under weak
supervision, rather than a comprehensive solution to AI safety challenges.

A. Additional Meterials on Experiments Setting

A.1. Details about baseline settings

We use two baselines. The first baseline generates PRDs directly using the vibe coding framework, and the
second baseline adopts a vanilla multi-turn interaction setting.

Vibe coding framework: We automate this process using a Docker environment. Specifically, we launch
Docker to run the corresponding vibe coding framework, then simulate test instructions as inputs to the
framework and require the model to generate outputs under an automatic acceptance mode. The final
execution results are obtained by saving the file system within the Docker container. Since we are unable
to simulate multi-turn user interactions within this framework, this part of the evaluation is conducted in a
single-turn setting.

Direct multi-turn interaction: This baseline simulates a user engaging in multi-turn interactions. We use the

same simulated user setup as above, but remove the dialogue strategy component.

A.2. Details about LLM judges

In this section, we descibe the details about how we conduct the alignment evalution based on the PRDs.

The two-stage method. Given the complexity of a requirements document, we adopt a two-stage evaluation
approach to assess alignment. First, the document is decomposed into five parts, each corresponding to one
functional module. The evaluation rubrics are similarly organized into five modules, enabling each component
to be assessed independently. Finally, the module-level scores are aggregated to obtain the overall evaluation
result. The two stage prompts are in Appendix C.6

Rubrics. We use LLM to generate rubrics for every data points. The rubrics are also formatted in tree-
structure to enable the two-stage evaluation. The rubrics generation prompts is present it Appendix C.8. The
following is an example for the rubrics.

Validation. To validate the effectiveness of LLM-judge, we compare the three LLMs’ ageements on 80 evalution
tasks. The results inidicates that the three popular LLM are consistent with each other.

Table 4 | Pairwise agreement scores among different models

Besides, we hired human annotators to label the reasonableness of the rubrics. Across all the rubrics in the
test set (the same 80 test cases as the above), only 0.5% of them are labled as unreasonable, which along with
the LLM agreement results, indicates the validation of our LLM-judge methods.

A.3. Details about user simulation

In the user simulator
The prompt we used to simulate non-expert users is presented in Appendix C.5.
experiments, we use Deepseek R1 as the simulation model, because we find it as the best one in role playing
and instruction following in the task. When we use claude model or gpt-5, both of them cannot perform as the
non-expert to say ‘DontCare’ or ‘DontKnow’.

We validate the agreement of user simulation with human annotators on a 272 sample test set. Given a prd
document as the implicit intention and the imcomplete dialogue, the human annotators are asked to complete
the interactions with models in one turn. The agreement is calculated on whether the user simulation model
has the same answer with the human annotator. Because we has constrained the answer to closed-form (e.g.
rankings or selections), the agreement could be easily judged.

The results are:

• The agreement between the human annotators is 0.722. The agreed parts are used as the gold standard

to evaluate the user simulation models.

• The agreement between Deepseek R1 and human annotators is 0.677.
• In the RL phase, we trained a SFT model as the user simulator for the rollout effiency. The agreement

between this model and human annotators is 0.707.

A.4. Details about RL training

The cold-start model was fine-tuned on 700 samples with a learning rate of 5𝑒 − 5. For the RL experiments,
we used a learning rate of 2𝑒 − 6 and a training batch size of 8, with a clipping range of [0.8, 1.2]. Unless
otherwise specified, we set the number of PPO epochs to 1 and the rollout size to 4, which achieved the best
empirical performance in our experiments.

As for training algorithm, we use a variant to GRPO (Shao et al., 2024). Compared to direct GRPO this is
better suited to multi-turn traces with non-shared prefixes and small per-prompt groups, avoiding unstable
per-group rescaling while still supporting dense token-level rewards via masked returns and global whitening.
The following shows how we calculate the advantage:

Model:
Question 1: Please imagine our ideal reader. Which of the following profiles best represents the group
you want to prioritize?
A. Professionals focused on current affairs: such as government officials, lawyers, academics, and
mid-to-senior corporate managers. They need in-depth, rigorous, data-driven analysis to support
decision-making or academic research, and they have very high standards for information reliability.
B. A younger generation passionate about public issues: such as university students, young professionals,
and social activists. They are intellectually engaged, care about social justice, the environment, and
culture, consume news via social media, and enjoy interaction and diverse perspectives.
C. General readers seeking reliable information: people from all walks of life who may not deeply study
complex political or economic issues, but are tired of clickbait and fake news and want a place to quickly,
clearly, and accurately understand major events.
You may choose one primary group or rank them by priority. This decision will directly influence our
subsequent choices regarding content depth, tone, and distribution channels.
Human: [A >C >B]- Conf[0.8]
Model:
Question 2: To build a strong competitive advantage and appeal most effectively to professionals, where
should we primarily invest our content resources?
A. Data-driven journalism: Use data analysis and visualizations to interpret news. In-depth reports
are grounded in rigorous data models and statistical analysis, providing quantitative decision support
rather than purely narrative reporting.
B. Investigative journalism: Build a brand known for hard-hitting investigations, investing significant
time and resources in long-term original reporting that exposes corruption, abuse of power, or issues
others fail to reach, establishing unmatched credibility.
C. Expert-led analysis: Develop an exclusive network of leading regional scholars, former government
officials, and industry leaders, featuring their in-depth analysis and forecasts on current affairs and
future trends.
D. Cross-regional comparative perspective: Focus on systematic, cross-country comparisons of shared
issues across Latin America (e.g., pension reform, digital economy policy, energy transition), offering a
broader, more strategic viewpoint.
You may choose one core direction or rank them. Your decision will guide our content strategy and
team building.

Steering LLMs via Scalable Interactive Oversight

The preference accumulated

## Product Positioning - Functional Specification
**1. Target Audience**
- **Primary:** Public-affairs-focused professionals (e.g., government officials, lawyers, academics,
analysts, senior managers) who require high-quality, in-depth, objective information for decision-making
or research.
- **Secondary:** General readers seeking clear, reliable news and tired of clickbait and information
noise.
**2. Differentiation Strategy**
- **Core focus: Data-driven journalism.** News is interpreted through data analysis and visualization
rather than opinion-led narratives. In-depth reporting is grounded in verifiable data and delivers
quantitative insights.
**3. Brand Value Proposition**
- **Slogan:** “Verifiable truth. Every story backed by data.”
- **Promise:** To provide data-validated, source-transparent reporting that strengthens trust in journal-
ism.
**4. Core Advantage**
* Strong data analysis combined with professional, interactive data visualization. * Priority on extracting
insights from public datasets (e.g., government, international organizations, financial markets).
### Key Implementation Notes
- Build a cross-disciplinary team of data-savvy journalists and journalist-minded data analysts.
- Ensure transparent data sourcing and basic chart interactivity to support credibility and user trust.

Then this would be used to update a new requirement tree, and this node would be marked as “completed”.

C. Prompts in the Framework

C.1. Interaction Model System Prompt

You are an experienced developer and product manager. Based on the user’s original intent,

design an advanced and complete solution for the software the user wants to build.

Your task is to guide the user through professional questioning across multiple rounds of
interaction to help them clarify their thinking, make key decisions, uncover complete
product requirements, and ultimately produce a professional, actionable product document.

# Current Focus
You are conducting an in-depth discussion specifically about the "{node.name}" feature.
Feature path: {context_path}
Feature description: {node.description}

# Discussion Goals
Deeply understand the user’s concrete requirements for "{node.name}", typically including:
{chr(10).join(f’- {func}’ for func in all_features) if all_features else "- Specific
implementation requirements for this feature"}
You may adjust this list at any time based on the user’s needs and preferences as the
interaction proceeds.

# Full Requirement Context from the User
{original_query}

# Role Requirements
1. Discuss only topics related to "{node.name}" and avoid other features.
2. Ensure alignment and advancement: your plan must satisfy all of the user’s requirements

(both initially stated and later clarified) and also be sufficiently advanced.

3. Ask key questions: after forming a plan, ask the user to decide on the essential
choices. For requirements that are already clear or for cases where you truly know the
optimal choice, you do not need user confirmation.
4. After fully understanding the needs, output a detailed specification for this feature.
5. Upon completion, output "[End of Feature Discussion]".

# To best match the user’s needs
1. If the user responds with "DontCare", it indicates the current topic exceeds the user’s

scope or level of concern. Skip that part or adjust the questioning angle.

2. The user will express a confidence score for each decision (between 0 and 1, where 1
means very certain and 0 means very uncertain). If confidence is low, adapt the discussion

with stronger guidance and more explanation.

# To improve dialogue quality and supervise-ability, follow these methods to reduce
decision difficulty:
1. Iterative clarification: do not try to cover everything at once. Discuss module by
module according to the product’s logical structure to reduce supervision burden while
learning user preferences.
2. Explanation method: when a technical or product decision is needed, do not simply state

"we will use XX technology." Instead, explain in user-understandable terms to support

confident decision-making.
3. If the user answers "DontKnow", your question is likely too technical. Provide further
explanation.
4. Reduce response difficulty: use choice- or ranking-style questions to lower cognitive
load.

# Efficient Questioning Strategy

## Metacognitive Check
- Ask as needed: "Do these directions cover what you care about?"
- If not, proactively adjust the dimensions of questioning.

## Feature Positioning Strategy
- Use dimension-based choices to quickly locate user focus: "For this feature, what
matters more to you: efficiency, quality assurance, ease of use, cost control, or other?"
- Plan subsequent discussion according to the selected dimension.
- If the user chooses "DontCare", your dimensions may not cover their true concern -- try

a different angle.

27

Steering LLMs via Scalable Interactive Oversight

# Output the Feature Specification After Discussion
After the discussion, summarize and output the specification for this feature based on the
conversation and your decisions. Keep it concise but comprehensive, and do not add points
beyond what was discussed. Use the following format:

## {node.name} Feature Specification

### Overview (required)
[Describe the purpose of the current module]

### Core Subfeatures (required)
[Describe the core subfeatures in detail]

### Key Technical Points (if discussed)
[Key implementation notes]

### UI Elements (if discussed)
[Description of UI elements]

### Interaction Logic (if discussed)
[Description of interaction logic]

[End of Feature Discussion]

C.2. Tree Initialization Prompt

You will act as a senior Product Director. Given a user’s requirement, you are expected to

conduct a requirements interview with the user. Ultimately, you will confirm a

requirements document together with the user. This document will include the following
sections:

- Product Overview
- Core Functional Modules
- Non-functional Requirements
- User Experience Design
- Business Rules

The purpose of this task is to design a comprehensive interview planning framework that
covers all relevant aspects involved in the requirements interview, while remaining
aligned with the user’s original intent.

User requirements may be highly ambiguous. You are expected to leverage your understanding

of the current industry landscape to expand and refine what the user intends to build,

and to produce an interview plan that is as complete and systematic as possible.

Objective:
You need to output an interview planning design corresponding to the user’s requirement.
The design should support a multi-level hierarchical structure:
- Each module may contain submodules
- Submodules may further contain more fine-grained elements

The highest-level modules must correspond to the main sections of the requirements
document:

C.3. Tree Updating Prompt

# Plan Update Task

You are a product development assistant. Based on the completed interaction results, and
the user’s original request, further learn the user’s intent and assess whether the
subsequent feature plan needs adjustment.

Our requirement for the plan is: while aligning with the user’s preferences and intent,
keep the plan advanced and complete.

## Original User Request
{original_query}

## Recently Completed Feature Module
**Module Name**: {completed_node.name}
**Module Path**: {completed_node.path}
**Module Description**: {completed_node.description}

{accumulated_context}

## Current Full Feature Plan
‘‘‘json
{json.dumps(current_plan, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)}
‘‘‘

## Remaining Unresolved Feature Modules
{remaining_node_info}

## Task Instructions
Based on the accumulated interaction results, assess whether to adjust the subsequent
development plan. You may:

1. Add new features: if a new module is needed to better meet user needs or improve
completeness
2. Remove features: if certain features or subfeatures have become unnecessary
3. Modify features: adjust descriptions, subfeatures, or structure of existing features
4. Keep unchanged: if the current plan is still appropriate

29

Steering LLMs via Scalable Interactive Oversight

## Output Format Requirements
If changes are needed, output the revised full plan JSON (same format as the current plan).

If no changes are needed, output only: ‘NO_CHANGES_NEEDED‘

The revised JSON should:
- Keep the top-level titles unchanged unless the user explicitly asks; do not add or
remove them
- Keep completed modules unchanged (is_processed: true)
- Ensure the new plan is logically sound and clearly structured
- Maintain similar overall complexity to the original plan; over-detailing is not our goal

Please start your analysis and output the result:

C.4. Document Generator Prompt

You are a seasoned Product Director who needs to synthesize the detailed discussion
results of multiple feature modules into a complete, professional Product Requirements
Document (PRD).

# Original User Request
{original_query}

{module_context}

# Detailed Specifications of Each Feature Module
{combined_specs}

# Task Requirements
1. Based on the specifications of each feature module, generate a complete PRD. A PRD
typically includes:
- Product Overview
- Core Feature Modules
- Non-Functional Requirements
- User Experience Design
- Business Rules

2. Ensure the document has a clear structure and logical coherence.
3. Integrate all feature modules, avoiding duplication and conflicts.
4. Follow the detailed specifications; do not introduce new features. Only reorganize and
combine the content of each module.
5. Do not omit content or features.

Please begin synthesizing the final document:

C.5. User Simulation Prompt

# Role Setup
You are an entrepreneur with strong business vision but unfamiliar with technology. You
cannot write code and do not understand technical jargon. You only understand content
explained in non-technical terms, and your technical comprehension is roughly at a high-
school level.

You want to build the following product; this is your complete requirement: <prd_content>{
prd_content}</prd_content>

However, because you lack professional knowledge, you can imagine these functional needs
but cannot articulate them precisely.

Now, a product manager is eliciting your requirements. You will answer their questions
according to the rules below to help clarify your product.

# Current Focus
We are now discussing the "{node.name}" part specifically.

30

Steering LLMs via Scalable Interactive Oversight

Location: {context_path}

# Requirements
1. Only answer questions related to "{node.name}"; do not discuss other modules.
2. Answer based on your true needs; do not fabricate.
3. Consider previously confirmed specifications and keep consistency.
4. Firmly and accurately distinguish scope boundaries: your complete requirement document
already contains all the features and level of detail you care about. You do not care how
features outside that document are implemented, nor how finer-grained submodules are
implemented. If asked about something you do not care about, you must respond with [
DontCare].
5. Firmly and accurately distinguish technical boundaries: you cannot write code and do
not understand technical terms. You only understand content explained in non-technical
form, with technical comprehension at a high-school level. For content you do not
understand, you must respond with [DontKnow].
6. Your responses must be only one of the following types. Aside from [DontKnow], [
DontCare], and a direct answer, do not include any additional explanatory statements (e.g.,

references or citations).
- If the question cannot be answered within your knowledge scope, reply [DontKnow].
- If you do not care how a feature is implemented, or the question exceeds the
granularity you care about, reply [DontCare].
- If you can answer directly, do not add extra explanation. If the question is a closed-
form choice or ranking, reply only with the answer.
- Additionally, provide a decision confidence: a float between 0 and 1 indicating how
certain you are. This certainty typically depends on how well the question is covered by
your documented needs.
- Format: Answer: [ ] - Confidence: [ ]

C.6. Evaluation Prompts

We evaluate PRDs in two stages: (1) split the full PRD into module-specific segments according to the evaluation
modules; (2) perform module-wise rubric evaluation and aggregate scores.

C.6.1. Split PRD into Modules

You are a document analysis expert. Please split the Product Requirements Document (PRD)
into the corresponding parts based on the given evaluation modules.

## Available Evaluation Modules:
{modules_info}

## Splitting Requirements:
1. Read the PRD carefully.
2. Split the content by topic and functionality into the best matching module.
3. Each module should include all related content from the PRD.
4. If some content is ambiguous about which module it belongs to, include it in all
plausible modules.
5. Ensure all important content is covered; do not miss key information.

## Output Format:
The output must be valid JSON. Double quotes inside string values must be escaped with \":
‘‘‘json
{

"Module 1 Name": "Content belonging to this module...",
"Module 2 Name": "Content belonging to this module...",
...

}
‘‘‘

## Important Notes:
- Ensure the JSON syntax is correct; escape double quotes in string values as \".
- Do not include unescaped double quotes in JSON string values.
- Output JSON only; do not include additional text.

## PRD to Split:
{md_content}

31

Steering LLMs via Scalable Interactive Oversight

Please analyze the document carefully and split it intelligently into the corresponding
evaluation modules. Ensure the output is valid JSON.

C.6.2. Module-wise Evaluation

You are a product functionality evaluation expert. You need to evaluate whether a Product
Requirements Document (PRD) satisfies the given rubrics.

## Scoring Rules
- If the PRD explicitly mentions the related feature or requirement: score 1
- If the PRD does not mention it at all: score 0
- If it is mentioned but insufficiently described: score 0.5
- The total score is the average of all rubric scores

## Output Format
‘‘‘json
{

"eval": {

"Description of criterion 1": 1,
"Description of criterion 2": 0,
...

},
"score": 0.5

}
‘‘‘

## Rubrics
{rubrics}

## PRD to Evaluate
{prd_doc}

Please read the PRD carefully, score each rubric, and compute the overall score. Output
JSON only; do not output any other content.

C.7. Progressive Reward Prompt

You are an evaluation expert. Your task is to evaluate the effectiveness of a requirements

interview. Given the summary of the n-th requirements interview dialogue, the list of

summaries from the previous n-1 dialogues, and the list of target functional points.

Your specific evaluation task is to assess whether, after completing the n-th dialogue,
the coverage of the target functional points has been improved compared to the previous n
-1 dialogues.

<Summary of the n-th dialogue>
{node_document}
</Summary of the n-th dialogue>

<Historical dialogues from the previous n-1 rounds>
{history_summary}
</Historical dialogues from the previous n-1 rounds>

<Target functional points>
{features_text}
</Target functional points>

If it has promoted (improved coverage), output 1; if it has not promoted, output 0.
Please output in JSON format and do not output any other content.
{{

"score": 0 or 1,
"reason": "..."

}}

C.8. Rubrics Generation Prompt

You will act as a senior Product Director. Given an example PRD, you need to extract key
points as scoring samples (rubrics) to evaluate reproducibility when rebuilding the target

website/product.

A product typically spans several domains: Core Functionality, Interaction Design,
Technical Architecture, Business Value, etc.

## Output Format
(Each extracted requirement should follow: [Domain] - [Specific requirement description])
‘‘‘json
{

"rubrics": ["Requirement 1", "Requirement 2", "Requirement 3", ...]

}
‘‘‘

## Notes
- Each requirement must be a complete sentence describing a fully specified requirement.
- Keep requirements independent, complete, and actionable.
- Each requirement should represent a single subfeature, e.g., [Privacy Settings] - [The
system should support three visibility levels for resumes: public, password-protected, and

private.]

- Critically, include all functional points present in the PRD; do not omit any.
- Do not fabricate content.
- Ensure the output JSON is valid and directly parseable.

## Good Examples
- [Content Pagination] - [The system should intelligently handle PDF pagination to prevent

truncation of key information.]

- [Containerized Deployment] - [The system should provide a complete Docker-based
container deployment solution and environment configuration options.]

## Bad Examples (and why)
- [User Authentication and Security Management] - The system should provide email signup (
with real-time password strength checking), Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth, guest mode,
delayed email verification post signup, and 6-digit code password recovery.

Reason: This mixes multiple subfeatures with weak cohesion; it should be decomposed into
separate independent subfeatures.

- Core Advantages - fully free & open source, 20-30 high-quality templates, intelligent AI

assistance, multilingual support, community-driven, privacy & security.
Reason: Not in the required format; also not a single product feature but rather a
product overview.

- [Performance Metrics] - [Page load time < 3s and API response time < 500ms.]

Reason: Contains two distinct subfeatures; they should be split.

## PRD Document
{prd_doc}

Please output only a JSON string with the array under "rubrics"; do not include any other
text.
