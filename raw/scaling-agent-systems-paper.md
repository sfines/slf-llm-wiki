## Abstract

Agents, language model-based systems that are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting are becoming the dominant paradigm for real-world AI applications. Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored. We address this by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We first formalize a definition for agentic evaluation and characterize scaling laws as the interplay between agent quantity, coordination structure, model capability, and task properties. We evaluate this across four benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. With five canonical agent architectures (Single-Agent and four Multi-Agent Systems: Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid), instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations. We derive a predictive model using coordination metrics, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.524, enabling prediction on unseen task domains. We identify three effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.8% on parallelizable tasks, while decentralized coordination excels on web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, every multi-agent variants degraded performance by 39-70%. The framework predicts the optimal coordination strategy for 87% of held-out configurations. Out-of-sample validation on GPT-5.2, achieves MAE=0.071 and confirms four of five scaling principles generalize to unseen frontier models.

Agents, language model (LM)-based systems that are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting are
becoming the dominant paradigm for real-world AI applications. Despite this widespread adoption, the
principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on
heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling
principles for agent systems. We first formalize a definition for agentic evaluation and characterize
scaling laws as the interplay between agent quantity, coordination structure, model capability, and task
properties. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus,
PlanCraft, and Workbench, spanning financial reasoning, web navigation, game planning, and
workflow execution. Using five canonical agent architectures (Single-Agent System and four Multi-Agent
Systems: Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid), instantiated across three LLM families, we
perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations, standardizing tools, prompt structures,
and token budgets to isolate architectural effects from implementation confounds. We derive a predictive
model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and
redundancy, that achieves cross-validated 𝑅2=0.524, enabling prediction on unseen task domains by
modeling task properties rather than overfitting to a specific dataset. We identify three dominant
effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off : under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer
disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: we observe that coordination
yields diminishing or negative returns ( ˆ𝛽=−0.404, 𝑝<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed an
empirical threshold of ∼45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify
errors 17.2× through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4×.
Crucially, coordination benefits are task-contingent. Centralized coordination improves performance
by 80.8% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on
dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%). Yet for sequential reasoning tasks, every multi-agent
variant we tested degraded performance by 39–70%. The framework predicts the optimal coordination
strategy for 87% of held-out configurations. Out-of-sample validation on GPT-5.2, released after our
study, achieves MAE=0.071 and confirms four of five scaling principles generalize to unseen frontier
models, providing a quantitatively predictive framework for agentic scaling based on measurable task
properties.

1. Introduction

Agents (Wang et al., 2024a), language model-driven systems that operate through iterative cycles of
reasoning, planning, and acting, adapting their behavior based on environmental or tool-generated
feedback, have achieved remarkable performance in diverse applications, from code generation
(Yang et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024), web browsing (Wei et al., 2025; Yao et al., 2022), medical
decision-making (Heydari et al., 2025; Kim et al., 2024; McDuff et al., 2025), finance (Yu et al.,
2025), sustainability (Zhang et al., 2025b), to scientific discovery (Gottweis et al., 2025; Mitchener
et al., 2025). As tasks grow in complexity and require sustained environmental interaction, the
field has increasingly turned to multi-agent systems (MAS), relying on the premise that specialized

Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems

Figure 1 | Agent Scaling across model intelligence and system architectures. Average performance
(%) across four agentic benchmarks improves consistently with increasing model Intelligence Index
(see Appendix A) across three major LLM families (OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic) under different
agent configurations. Single Agent System (SAS) serves as reference trajectories, while Multi Agent
System (MAS) variants (Centralized, Decentralized, Independent, and Hybrid) reveal distinct scaling
behaviors (see Table 2 for architecture comparisons). All percentage deltas annotated in the figure
(e.g., +8.7%, +8.1%, –4.6%) indicate relative performance change of the best-performing MAS variant
compared to the SAS baseline at the same Intelligence Index. Centralized and hybrid coordination
generally yield superior scaling efficiency, suggesting that collaborative agentic structures amplify
capability gains more effectively than individual scaling alone.

collaboration consistently outperforms single-agent systems (SAS) (Guo et al., 2024; Tran et al., 2025).
Previous work has made positive claims about multi-agent systems: “More agents is all you need” (Li
et al., 2024), suggesting that agent collaboration follows collaborative scaling principles (Qian et al.,
2025), and that MAS consistently outperforms single-agent systems (SAS) on complex tasks (Chen
et al., 2024b; Du et al., 2023). Yet, despite rapid adoption, there remains no principled quantitative
framework to predict when adding agents amplifies performance and when it erodes it. This gap
leaves practitioners relying on heuristics, hindering both the emergence of a science of agent systems
and, critically for real-world deployment, the ability to determine when multi-agent coordination
provides genuine value over simpler single-agent alternatives.

To determine when multi-agent coordination provides benefit, we first establish which task
categories require agentic capabilities. A critical prerequisite is distinguishing between agentic
and non-agentic evaluation paradigms. Expanding from the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC)
introduced in (Zhu et al., 2025), we characterize agentic tasks as those requiring: (i) sustained multi-
step interactions with an external environment, (ii) iterative information gathering under partial
observability, and (iii) adaptive strategy refinement based on environmental feedback.

These characteristics differentiate tasks like web browsing (Wei et al., 2025), financial trading (Yu
et al., 2025), software engineering (Jimenez et al., 2024), and interactive planning (Dagan et al.,
2024) from traditional static benchmarks, tasks solvable through single-shot reasoning without envi-
ronmental feedback, which lack external environments, are fully observed, or require identical solution
strategies (Kapoor et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024). This distinction matters profoundly because, while
recent agentic benchmarks have emerged (e.g., SWE-Bench (Jimenez et al., 2024), 𝜏2-Bench (Barres
et al., 2025), TerminalBench), multi-agent system evaluations have been conducted predominantly
on non-agentic tasks, potentially providing misleading guidance about when collaboration provides
value. This distinction is practically consequential: while LLMs achieve high accuracy on isolated

code generation tasks like HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), real-world deployment requires agentic
capabilities—iterative debugging, repository navigation, and adaptive strategy refinement—as exem-
plified by interactive coding assistants (e.g., Cursor, Copilot Workspace). Multi-agent systems that
show monotonic improvement with team size on static benchmarks (reaching 89% on HumanEval
with five agents) exhibit fundamentally different scaling behavior when evaluated on tasks requiring
sustained environmental interaction, where coordination overhead and error propagation dynamics
dominate.

Fundamentally, this distinction reflects a trade-off between context integration and diversity (Du
et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2024). Single-agent systems maximize context integration by maintaining
a unified memory stream in which all reasoning steps share full access to prior history, enabling
effectively constant-time access to global context. In contrast, multi-agent systems impose intrinsic
information fragmentation (Tran et al., 2025): while parallel agents enable diverse exploration, they
incur an unavoidable coordination tax in which the global context must be compressed into inter-agent
messages. This lossy communication increases synchronization overhead and cognitive load (?),
fundamentally altering the scaling behavior of collaboration.

The underlying dynamics explain this discrepancy: on agentic tasks, coordination overhead scales
with interaction depth, agents operate on progressively divergent world states, and errors cascade
through execution chains rather than being corrected through voting. Recent work has identified
cases where single strong models match or exceed multi-agent systems (Gao et al., 2025), yet the
evaluation literature provides limited guidance on what factors determine collaborative success,
whether semantic diversity predicts team performance, how architectural choices shape coordination
costs, or whether agents can detect and correct failures in extended interactions.

The problem is further compounded by rapid progress in frontier model capabilities. As base
LLMs gain extended context windows, sophisticated tool use, and improved self-reflection, the unique
value proposition of multi-agent collaboration becomes unclear. The answer likely depends on task
characteristics and architectural choices that remain to be systematically quantified.

Two fundamental challenges hinder progress toward principled multi-agent design. First, existing
MAS evaluations compare architectures using different prompts, tools, or computational budgets,
conflating architectural effects with implementation choices and precluding clean causal attribution.
Second, evaluations focus exclusively on final accuracy metrics without examining process dynamics
such as coordination overhead, error propagation, and information flow that determine whether
collaboration succeeds or fails. We know from human team performance (Lencioni, 2002; McGrath,
1964) that team effectiveness depends on composition, coordination mechanisms, and member
differentiation. Yet we lack comparable empirical understanding of how these principles translate to
artificial agents, leaving practitioners without quantitative guidance for architecture selection.

To address these challenges, we present a controlled evaluation establishing the principles for agent
coordination. Our experimental design isolates architectural effects by controlling for implementation
confounds which maintains identical task prompts, tools, and computational budgets across all config-
urations, while systematically varying only coordination structure and model capability. We evaluate
five canonical architectures: Single Agent System (SAS) and four Multi-Agent variants (Independent,
Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three major LLM families (OpenAI, Google,
Anthropic) spanning diverse capability levels, on four representative agentic benchmarks: (1) web
browsing (BrowseComp-Plus (Chen et al., 2025)), (2) financial analysis (Finance-Agent (Bigeard
et al., 2025)), (3) game planning (PlanCraft (Dagan et al., 2024)), and (4) realistic workplace tasks
(Workbench (Styles et al., 2024)). Across 𝑁=180 controlled configurations with matched token
budgets, we derive a scaling principle across tested domains quantifying how performance emerges
from empirically measured coordination properties.

Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems

In contrast to prior claims that “more agents is all you need”, our evaluation reveals that the
effectiveness of multi-agent systems is governed by quantifiable trade-offs between architectural
properties and task characteristics. We establish a predictive framework using empirical coordination
metrics: efficiency (success/overhead ratio), error amplification factors, message density and redun-
dancy, achieving cross-validated 𝑅2=0.524 (explaining more than half of the performance variance on
held-out data) without dataset-specific parameters. Critically, this framework generalizes beyond
training configurations: the model correctly predicts optimal architectures for 87% of held-out task
configurations, demonstrating extrapolation to unseen task structures.

Our analysis identifies three patterns. First, a tool-coordination trade-off (𝛽=−0.267, 𝑝<0.001):
tool-heavy tasks (e.g., 16-tool software engineering) suffer from multi-agent coordination overhead,
with efficiency penalties compounding as environmental complexity increases. Second, a capability
ceiling (𝛽=−0.404, 𝑝<0.001): tasks where single-agent performance already exceeds 45% accuracy
experience negative returns from additional agents, as coordination costs exceed diminishing improve-
ment potential. Third, we observe architecture-dependent error amplification. Independent systems
amplify errors 17.2× through unchecked error propagation, where individual mistakes cascade to
the final output. Centralized coordination, however, contains this to 4.4× by enforcing validation
bottlenecks that intercept errors before aggregation. Performance spans +81% relative improvement
(structured financial reasoning under centralized coordination) to −70% degradation (sequential
planning under independent coordination), demonstrating that architecture-task alignment, not num-
ber of agents, determines collaborative success. Importantly, optimal architectures vary systematically:
decentralized coordination benefits tasks requiring parallel exploration of high-entropy search spaces
(dynamic web navigation: +9.2%), while all multi-agent variants universally degrade performance on
tasks requiring sequential constraint satisfaction (planning: −39% to −70%), where coordination
overhead fragments reasoning capacity under fixed computational budgets. We synthesize these
findings into quantitative architecture selection rules (Section 4.3) achieving 87% prediction accuracy
on held-out configurations. The underlying mechanisms driving these patterns are interpretable:
the tool-coordination trade-off arises because multi-agent systems fragment the per-agent token
budget, leaving insufficient capacity for complex tool orchestration; the capability ceiling reflects
that coordination overhead becomes a net cost when baseline performance is already high; and
architecture-dependent error amplification stems from the presence or absence of validation bottle-
necks that catch errors before propagation. These mechanistic insights enable practitioners to move
from architectural heuristics to principled, measurement-driven deployment decisions.

Our primary contributions are:

• Formalization of Agentic Evaluation rigor: We redefine rigorous agentic assessment by distinguish-
ing it from static reasoning tasks (e.g., MMLU). We establish that valid agentic evaluation requires
three necessary conditions: sustained multi-step environment interaction, iterative information
gathering under partial observability, and adaptive strategy refinement based on feedback.

• Controlled evaluation of agent systems: We establish a framework for comparing agent archi-
tectures, controlling for implementation confounds to isolate the effects of coordination structure.
Our framework spans 180 configurations across three LLM families and four diverse benchmarks,
enabling the causal attribution of performance differences to architectural choices rather than
stochastic variations.

• Intelligence-Coordination alignment: We characterize the non-linear relationship between foun-
dational model capabilities and agentic performance. We demonstrate that while higher capability
(Intelligence Index) offers accelerating returns, these gains are not automatic; they strictly depend
on architectural alignment. Without correct coordination structures, foundational improvements
are often negated by coordination overhead.

Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems

• Quantitative scaling principles and architecture alignment: We derive a mixed-effects model
(𝑅2=0.524) using empirical coordination metrics—efficiency (𝐸𝑐), error amplification (𝐴𝑒), and
redundancy (𝜌) to quantify how performance emerges from the interplay of reasoning capability
and task properties. This framework identifies fundamental limits on coordination, specifically
a tool-coordination trade-off (𝛽=−0.267) where tool-heavy workflows suffer from coordination
tax, and safety bounds where centralized verification reduces error amplification from 17.2× to
4.4×. Leveraging these mechanisms, we demonstrate that architecture selection is governed by
measurable task features (e.g., decomposability) rather than simple agent scaling, achieving 87%
accuracy in predicting optimal architectures on held-out tasks.

2. Related Work

Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) versus Single-Agent Systems (SAS) Understanding the difference
between single-agent and multi-agent systems remains foundational to characterizing architectural
effects. Following Tran et al. (2025) and Guo et al. (2024), we define a Single-Agent System as one
that features a solitary reasoning locus: all perception, planning, and action occur within a single
sequential loop controlled by one LLM instance, even when employing tool use (Yao et al., 2023),
self-reflection (Shinn et al., 2023), or chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2022). Critically,
self-reflection mechanisms do not constitute multi-agent collaboration, as they operate within a single
decision-making locus (Weng, 2023). A Multi-Agent System comprises multiple LLM-backed agents
communicating through structured message passing, shared memory, or orchestrated protocols (Xi
et al., 2025). MAS architectures vary by topology: Independent systems aggregate isolated outputs;
Decentralized enable peer-to-peer exchange (Du et al., 2023); Centralized route through orchestrators
(Hong et al., 2024); Hybrid combine hierarchical control with lateral communication (Dang et al.,
2025). MAS evaluation has moved beyond early assumptions of uniform superiority (Li et al., 2024;
Qian et al., 2025) towards a nuanced understanding driven by domain complexity. Comprehensive
surveys characterize collaboration mechanisms across coordination protocols (Tran et al., 2025) and
agent profiling patterns (Guo et al., 2024). However, there exist empirical challenges: Gao et al.
(2025) show benefits diminish as base models improve, with frontier models often outperforming
teams; Cemri et al. (2025) identify 14 failure modes (Cohen’s Kappa=0.88); Zhang et al. (2025a)
achieve comparable performance at 6-45% cost through dynamic architecture search; and Anthropic
(2024) report agents consume 15× more tokens. Theoretical foundations from Sumers et al. (2023)
propose cognitive architectures contextualizing agents within AI’s broader history. The question
of when multi-agent coordination provides value over single strong models with tool use remains
empirically open, with Qian et al. (2025)’s proposed scaling laws showing no significant universal
pattern (Wang et al., 2024a), motivating our systematic evaluation.

Agentic Tasks and Benchmarks We define agentic tasks following Zhu et al. (2025) as requiring:
(1) sustained multi-step environment interactions, (2) iterative information gathering under partial
observability, and (3) adaptive strategy refinement from feedback—differentiating tasks like web
browsing (Wei et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2024), financial trading (Bigeard et al., 2025), software
engineering (Jimenez et al., 2024), and planning (Dagan et al., 2024) from static benchmarks.
Non-agentic tasks evaluate single-shot inference without environmental interaction: GSM8K (Cobbe
et al., 2021) (direct chain-of-thought math), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) (parametric knowledge),
HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) (specification-complete coding), and SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016)
(single-pass comprehension). On non-agentic benchmarks, multi-agent systems show monotonic
improvement through ensemble effects (89% on HumanEval with five agents), as voting corrects errors
without sequential compounding (Kapoor et al., 2025). This distinction matters profoundly: in agentic

5

Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems

settings, coordination overhead scales with interaction depth, agents operate on divergent world
states (34% overlap after 10 interactions), and errors cascade rather than cancel (Kapoor et al., 2025).
Zhu et al. (2025) introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist addressing flaws causing 100% relative
misestimation. Evolution spans Liu et al. (2024)’s 8-environment evaluation (4k-13k responses) to
specialized frameworks: Jimenez et al. (2024) (GitHub resolution), Zhou et al. (2024) (812 web
tasks), Xu et al. (2025) (30% autonomous completion), and Paglieri et al. (2025) (vision-based RL).
Yao et al. (2023) formalizes reasoning-acting synergy; Weng (2023) characterizes agents requiring
planning, memory, and tools; Kapoor et al. (2025) reveals narrow accuracy focus without cost metrics
yields needlessly complex agents. Tasks showing MAS advantages in single-shot settings often exhibit
opposite patterns under genuine interaction, indicating architectural benefits are task-contingent,
motivating our isolation of coordination effects across diverse agentic domains.

Scaling Laws and Coordination Mechanisms Understanding performance scaling in multi-agent
systems requires distinguishing collaborative scaling from neural scaling laws. While neural scaling
follows power laws requiring million-fold parameter increases for significant trends (Kaplan et al.,
2020), collaborative scaling exhibits logistic growth patterns emerging at substantially smaller scales
(Qian et al., 2025). Chen et al. (2024a) explore whether increased LLM calls alone drive perfor-
mance, finding compound inference systems follow distinct scaling behaviors from single-model
training. However, Wang et al. (2024a) note collaborative scaling shows no significant universal
pattern, suggesting domain-specific rather than general laws. Coordination mechanisms critically
determine whether collaboration amplifies or degrades performance: Hong et al. (2024) introduce
meta-programming workflows mitigating hallucination cascades; Chen et al. (2024b) demonstrate
emergent behaviors through structured interactions; Wu et al. (2024) provide general multi-agent
frameworks. Recent work reveals architecture-task alignment matters more than team size: Zhang
et al. (2025a) achieve superior performance at 6-45% cost through query-dependent configurations;
Dang et al. (2025) show puppeteer orchestration improvements stem from compact cyclic structures;
Du et al. (2023) demonstrate peer-to-peer debate effectiveness depends on task decomposability, with
Smit et al. (2023) further showing that multi-agent debate does not reliably outperform single-agent
strategies such as self-consistency, suggesting benefits are highly task- and hyperparameter-sensitive.
These findings collectively indicate coordination benefits arise from matching communication topology
to task structure not from scaling the number of agents, establishing the foundation for principled
architectural design rather than heuristic “more agents is better” approaches.

3. Agent Systems and Tasks

3.1. System Definition

Building on multi-agent system formalism (Guo et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2025), an agent system
S = ( 𝐴, 𝐸, 𝐶, Ω) consists of a set of agents 𝐴 = {𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛} (where 𝑛 ≥ 1), a shared environment 𝐸,
a communication topology 𝐶, and an orchestration policy Ω. When | 𝐴| = 1, we refer to this as a
Single-Agent System (SAS); when | 𝐴| > 1, a Multi-Agent System (MAS). Each agent 𝑎𝑖 perceives,
reasons, and acts within the shared environment via iterative feedback.

Formally, each agent 𝑎𝑖 is defined as a tuple 𝑆𝑖 = (Φ𝑖, A𝑖, 𝑀𝑖, 𝜋𝑖), where:

• Φ𝑖 is the reasoning policy (typically an LLM)
• A𝑖 = {ToolCall(𝑡, 𝜃) : 𝑡 ∈ T , 𝜃 ∈ Θ𝑡} is the action space consisting of tool usage, where T is the set of
available tools (e.g., web search, code execution) and Θ𝑡 represents valid parameter configurations
for tool 𝑡

6

Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems

• 𝑀𝑖 is the internal memory
• 𝜋𝑖 : H → A𝑖 is the decision function mapping observation histories to actions

The observation history space H contains sequences of action-observation pairs. The decision
function 𝜋𝑖 is instantiated by the reasoning policy Φ𝑖 (the LLM): given a history ℎ𝑖,𝑡, the LLM generates
a reasoning trace and selects the next action.

For instance, a history ℎ𝑖,𝑡 = [(“search(query=‘pandas’)”, “Found 5 files”), ...] is processed by Φ𝑖

to produce the next tool call 𝛼𝑖,𝑡+1.

At timestep 𝑡, agent 𝑎𝑖 selects an action 𝛼𝑖,𝑡 ∈ A𝑖 according to:

𝛼𝑖,𝑡 = 𝜋𝑖 (ℎ𝑖,𝑡),

𝑜𝑖,𝑡 = 𝐸(𝛼𝑖,𝑡),

ℎ𝑖,𝑡+1 = 𝑓𝑖 (ℎ𝑖,𝑡, 𝛼𝑖,𝑡, 𝑜𝑖,𝑡),

where 𝐸 denotes the environment and ℎ𝑖,0 = {𝑠0} contains the initial task specification. The history
update function 𝑓𝑖 : H × A𝑖 × O → H appends the new action-observation pair to the agent’s
history: ℎ𝑖,𝑡+1 = 𝑓𝑖 (ℎ𝑖,𝑡, 𝛼𝑖,𝑡, 𝑜𝑖,𝑡) = ℎ𝑖,𝑡 ⊕ (𝛼𝑖,𝑡, 𝑜𝑖,𝑡), subject to context window truncation when |ℎ𝑖,𝑡+1| >
MAX_TOKENS. This update mechanism applies uniformly to both SAS and MAS configurations.
Communication between agents occurs through explicit message passing in the orchestration layer.

Single-Agent System (SAS). A Single-Agent System contains one reasoning locus (| 𝐴| = 1 where
𝐴 is the agent set). All perception, reasoning, and action occur within a single sequential loop,
producing computational complexity 𝑂(𝑘) where 𝑘 is the number of reasoning iterations. SAS has
zero communication overhead and minimal memory 𝑂(𝑘), but limited capacity for decomposition or
verification.

Multi-Agent System (MAS). A Multi-Agent System is an agent system S with | 𝐴| > 1, where agents
interact through communication topology 𝐶 and orchestration policy Ω.

Communication topology 𝐶 defines information flow patterns between agents:

• Independent: 𝐶 = {(𝑎𝑖, 𝑎agg) : ∀𝑖} (agent-to-aggregator only, no peer communication)
• Centralized: 𝐶 = {(𝑎orch, 𝑎𝑖) : ∀𝑖} (orchestrator-to-agents only)
• Decentralized: 𝐶 = {(𝑎𝑖, 𝑎 𝑗) : ∀𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗} (all-to-all topology)
• Hybrid: 𝐶 = 𝐶centralized ∪ 𝐶peer (orchestrator plus limited peer-to-peer)

The orchestrator Ω (when present) determines: (i) how sub-agent outputs are aggregated (e.g.,
majority voting, weighted synthesis), (ii) whether the orchestrator can override sub-agent decisions,
(iii) whether memory persists across coordination rounds, and (iv) termination conditions based on
consensus or quality thresholds.

MAS architectures vary by how information and control propagate among agents, creating distinct
trade-offs between computation, coordination, and parallelization. Table 2 formalizes these trade-offs
using asymptotic notations over LLM calls, sequential depth, communication overhead, and memory
complexity. We selected these five architectures to form a structural ablation of coordination
mechanisms:

• Independent isolates the effect of parallelism (ensemble) without communication.
• Decentralized introduces peer-to-peer information fusion without hierarchy.
• Centralized introduces hierarchical verification and bottleneck control.

7

Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems

• Hybrid examines the synergy of hierarchy plus lateral flexibility.

This design allows us to causally attribute performance gains to specific coordination mechanics

rather than generic “multi-agent” effects. Specific configurations include:

• Independent MAS: 𝐴 = {𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛}, C = {(𝑎𝑖, 𝑎agg)}, Ω = synthesis_only. The synthesis_only
policy concatenates sub-agent outputs without cross-validation or majority voting; the aggregator
performs no analytical comparison of responses, ensuring that any performance differences arise
purely from parallel exploration rather than error correction. This achieves maximal parallelization
but minimal coordination, suitable for ensemble-style reasoning.

• Centralized MAS: 𝐴 = {𝑎orch, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛}, 𝐶 = {(𝑎orch, 𝑎𝑖) : ∀𝑖}, Ω = hierarchical. A single or-
chestrator coordinates 𝑟 rounds across 𝑛 sub-agents (𝑂(𝑟𝑛𝑘)). Sequential depth equals 𝑟 while
parallelization factor remains 𝑛. This design stabilizes reasoning but creates a bottleneck at the
orchestrator.

• Decentralized MAS: 𝐴 = {𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛}, 𝐶 = {(𝑎𝑖, 𝑎 𝑗) : ∀𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑖 ≠ 𝑗}, Ω = consensus. Agents communi-
cate in 𝑑 sequential debate rounds (𝑂(𝑑𝑛𝑘)). Memory complexity is 𝑂(𝑑𝑛𝑘) as each agent stores its
own debate history. This enables consensus formation through peer-to-peer discussion.

• Hybrid MAS: 𝐴 = {𝑎orch, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛}, 𝐶 = star + peer edges, Ω = hierarchical + lateral. Combines
orchestrated hierarchy with limited peer communication (𝑂(𝑟𝑛𝑘 + 𝑝𝑛) where 𝑝 is the number of
peer rounds). This inherits orchestrator control while enabling lateral exchange between agents.

Communication vs. Coordination. We distinguish communication (message passing between
agents) from coordination (strategic direction of agent activities). In centralized systems, coordination
occurs through the orchestrator’s task decomposition and progress monitoring, while communication
involves passing findings between orchestrator and workers. In decentralized systems, communication
and coordination are intertwined through debate rounds where agents both exchange information
and collectively steer problem-solving direction.

Thus, SAS represents the minimal unit of agentic computation (𝑂(𝑘)), while MAS configurations ex-
plore the scaling frontier of coordination complexity—ranging from fully parallel and communication-
free (Independent) to fully coupled with peer consensus (Decentralized). These configurations allow
us to test whether performance gains arise from agent coordination and specialization or merely from
increased compute through ensembling. Our taxonomy covers coordination patterns common in
LLM-based agentic systems.1

3.2. Agentic Tasks and Benchmarks

Following and extending the framework of Zhu et al. (2025), we operationalize a task 𝑇 as agentic
when optimal performance substantially benefits from adaptive interaction. Formally, if 𝜏 = {(𝑎𝑡, 𝑜𝑡)}𝑇
represents an interaction trajectory, then:

1Our taxonomy focuses on communication topology: one of several orthogonal MAS design dimensions including agent
specialization (Hong et al., 2024), memory architecture, and aggregation strategy. Classical coordination mechanisms (e.g.,
blackboard systems) assume structured message formats rather than natural language, limiting their direct applicability to
LLM-based agents. For comprehensive surveys of LLM-based multi-agent systems, see Guo et al. (2024); Xi et al. (2025).

stochastic environment dynamics. This definition captures tasks where interaction provides meaningful
advantage over the best possible single-shot approach.

The expected return of an optimal policy thus hinges on sequential observation–action feedback,
requiring agents to gather information, plan, and revise hypotheses under partial observability.
Building on the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (Zhu et al., 2025), we formalize three necessary
properties for agentic benchmarks:

• Sequential Interdependence: Later actions depend on earlier observations; a one-shot policy

cannot achieve high reward.

• Partial Observability: Critical state information is hidden and must be acquired through active

querying or tool use.

• Adaptive Strategy Formation: The policy must update internal beliefs based on new evidence

obtained through interaction.

Benchmarks lacking these conditions (e.g., GSM8K, MMLU) evaluate static reasoning rather than
agentic capabilities.2

Why Environment Feedback Matters. Real-world deployments such as coding assistants, financial
analysts, and embodied robots operate under uncertainty and non-stationarity. Tasks solvable by
direct prompting measure linguistic knowledge, whereas agentic benchmarks evaluate the process of
intelligence: exploration, adaptation, and coordination. Hence, our benchmarks are chosen such that
(i) base LLMs perform poorly in single-shot mode, and (ii) non-trivial performance requires multi-step
environment interaction.

Benchmark Design Principles. Extending the framework proposed by Zhu et al. (2025), we
introduce additional criteria to isolate architectural effects:

• Controlled Tool Interface: identical tool APIs and observation structures for all architectures to

eliminate confounds from external feedback quality.

• Controlled for Parametric Knowledge: within each model family, evaluation emphasizes adap-
tive reasoning over memorized facts. Cross-family comparisons (Section 4) account for inherent
knowledge base differences through baseline normalization.

• Action–Observation Loop Length: each benchmark enforces non-trivial trajectory length 𝐿 > 3 to

ensure sequential reasoning.

• Comparative Normalization: scores are normalized to the best single-agent baseline, measuring

coordination gain or loss.

4. Experiments & Results

To establish quantitative scaling principles for agentic systems, we investigate three research questions:

2We note that “agentic” is defined relative to current model capabilities. For instance, GSM8K could be posed as agentic
by providing calculator tools, though current LLMs do not require such scaffolding. Conversely, tasks that are agentic today
(e.g., SWE-Bench) may become solvable via single-shot inference as models improve. Our evaluation focuses on tasks that
currently require multi-step interaction for non-trivial performance.

RQ1. What factors determine agent system’s performance (e.g., model capability, coordination
architecture, task properties, their interactions)? We systematically vary each factor across 180
configurations to quantify their individual and joint contributions.

RQ2. Under what conditions does inter-agent coordination improve or degrade agent system’s
performance? We examine how task structure (e.g., decomposability, tool complexity, sequential
dependencies) moderates the effectiveness of different architectures.

RQ3. Can we derive quantitative scaling principles that predict best agent architecture for a given task
from measurable properties? We fit a mixed-effects model using empirical coordination metrics to test
whether continuous properties outperform categorical architecture labels in explaining performance
variance.

4.1. Setup

Benchmarks. We conducted 180 experiments across four representative benchmarks spanning
deterministic to open-world task structures: Workbench (deterministic code execution and tool use
with objective pass/fail criteria), Finance Agent (multi-step quantitative reasoning and risk assess-
ment), PlanCraft (spatiotemporal planning under constraints), and BrowseComp-Plus (dynamic
web navigation, information extraction, and cross-page synthesis). BrowseComp-Plus exhibits the
highest performance variability across experimental configurations (coefficient of variation 𝜎/𝜇 = 0.32
computed across all 45 BrowseComp-Plus runs spanning architectures and model families, where 𝜎 is
the standard deviation of success rates and 𝜇 is the mean success rate). By comparison, Workbench
(CV=0.12), Finance Agent (CV=0.18), and PlanCraft (CV=0.21) show lower variability, indicating

distributed reasoning provide significant advantages in structured economic domains. (c) PlanCraft
exhibits consistent degradation across all MAS variants (from -70% to -39%). The core difference
from Finance Agent lies in task structure, where Finance Agent tasks decompose into parallelizable
subtasks (e.g., separate agents can independently analyze revenue trends, cost structures, and market
comparisons, then synthesize findings), whereas PlanCraft requires strictly sequential state-dependent
reasoning, each crafting action modifies the inventory state that subsequent actions depend upon.

LLMs and intelligence Scaling. We evaluate three LLM families across multiple model sizes,
spanning externally standardized Intelligence Index values from 42 to 71 (a composite capability
score integrating reasoning, coding, and knowledge benchmarks; see Appendix A):

• OpenAI: GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5
• Google: Gemini 2.0 Flash, 2.5 Flash, 2.5 Pro
• Anthropic: Claude Sonnet 3.7, 4.0, 4.5

Strong consistency across families validates that coordination scaling follows model-agnostic princi-
ples: the maximum difference in architecture-specific scaling slopes between any two LLM families is
Δmax = 0.023 (computed as max𝑖, 𝑗 | ˆ𝛽arch,𝑖 − ˆ𝛽arch, 𝑗| across families 𝑖, 𝑗 ∈ {OpenAI, Google, Anthropic}),
with coefficient of variation CV < 0.02 across families. To ensure computational fairness, we matched
maximum total iterations between MAS and SAS systems: MAS configurations received equal computa-
tional budget through parallel agent processing (smaller per-agent iterations for 𝑛-agent teams), while
SAS received proportionally more reasoning rounds to compensate for lack of parallel deliberation.

Agent Architectures and Complexity. We tested five coordination topologies: Single-Agent System
(SAS) and four Multi-Agent System (MAS) variants: Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, and
Hybrid. Rather than attempting exhaustive coverage of all possible architectures, we selected these
four MAS configurations to form a structured ablation over two key coordination dimensions: (i)
orchestrator presence (hierarchical control vs. flat structure), and (ii) peer communication (direct
sub-agent interaction vs. isolated execution). Independent isolates pure ensemble effects without any
inter-agent communication; Centralized introduces hierarchical verification through an orchestrator
bottleneck; Decentralized enables peer-to-peer information fusion without hierarchy; and Hybrid
combines both mechanisms (see Table 2 for formal complexity characterization). This design enables
causal attribution of performance differences to specific coordination mechanisms rather than generic
“multi-agent” effects. Coordination complexity is parameterized by communication overhead: the
total number of inter-agent message exchanges required per task, yielding empirical values ranging
from 0% (SAS) to 515% (Hybrid), with Independent at 58%, Decentralized at 263%, and Centralized
at 285% relative to the single-agent baseline (see Table 5).

Metrics and Validation. Primary outcome is task success/accuracy (domain-dependent: factual
correctness for Finance Agent, task completion for Workbench, goal satisfaction for PlanCraft, page
synthesis accuracy for BrowseComp-Plus). Secondary metrics include: (i) factual error rate 𝐸 via
domain-specific validators (Cohen’s 𝜅 (Cohen, 1960): Finance Agent = 0.91, Workbench = 0.89,
PlanCraft = 0.87, BrowseComp-Plus = 0.88; exceeding 0.80, indicating strong inter-rater reliability);
(ii) information gain ΔI from pre- vs. post-coordination uncertainty proxies (see Eq. 2); (iii) token-
overlap structure across agent rationales, labeling tokens as unique (appearing in exactly one agent),
shared (two or more agents), or contradictory (semantic opposition detected when BERTScore
similarity < 0.3 between assertion pairs, i.e., 1 − BERTScore > 0.7, following the dissimilarity
threshold established by Zhang et al. (2019)); (iv) efficiency metrics including success per 1,000
tokens and cost-normalized performance. All metrics are normalized per reasoning turn and per
token to enable cross-architecture comparison. We select coordination metrics based on two criteria:
(i) direct measurability from experimental traces without requiring ground-truth labels beyond task
success, and (ii) coverage of distinct aspects of coordination–performance relationships identified in
prior work (Cemri et al., 2025). We excluded metrics requiring subjective human annotation (e.g.,
solution creativity) or those exhibiting high collinearity with included measures (e.g., total message
count correlates 𝑟 > 0.92 with overhead). Variance inflation factor (VIF) analysis confirmed no severe
multicollinearity among retained predictors (all VIF < 5). Specifically:

12

Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems

• Coordination overhead 𝑂 = (𝑇MAS − 𝑇SAS)/𝑇SAS × 100%: captures computational cost, identified

as a primary bottleneck in production multi-agent deployments.

• Message density 𝑐 (inter-agent messages per reasoning turn): quantifies communication intensity,

a key factor in coordination scaling.

• Redundancy rate 𝑅 (mean cosine similarity of agent output embeddings): measures agent

agreement, relevant for ensemble-based error correction.

• Coordination efficiency 𝐸𝑐 = 𝑆/(𝑇/𝑇SAS) (success normalized by relative turn count): normalizes

success by cost for deployment decisions.

• Error amplification 𝐴𝑒 = 𝐸MAS/𝐸SAS (relative failure probability): directly tests whether MAS

corrects or propagates errors.

4.2. Main Results

MAS exhibits domain-dependence with architectural variation. Multi-agent systems demon-
strate highly heterogeneous performance across task domains, contingent on problem structure and
architectural choices. On Finance Agent, MAS achieve substantial improvements: Centralized reaches
+80.8% (mean 0.631 vs. SAS 0.349), Decentralized achieves +74.5% (0.609), and Hybrid reaches
+73.1% (0.604), driven by opportunities for distributed financial reasoning across multiple agents.
On Workbench, multi-agent systems show minimal gains: Decentralized achieves +5.7% (0.664 vs.
SAS 0.629), while Centralized and Hybrid both slightly underperform at -1.2%. On BrowseComp-Plus,
improvements remain modest: Decentralized achieves +9.2% (0.347 vs. SAS 0.318), with Centralized
essentially flat at +0.2%. Critically, PlanCraft exhibits universal performance degradation across all
multi-agent architectures. Centralized declines to −50.3% (0.282 vs. SAS 0.568), Decentralized to
−41.5% (0.332), Hybrid to −39.1% (0.346), and Independent to −70.1% (0.170). To understand this
stark contrast between Finance Agent’s gains and PlanCraft’s degradation, we examined execution
traces from both domains. In PlanCraft, efficient single-agent trajectories follow direct execution
paths. For example, crafting a diorite_wall:

Turn 1: search("diorite_wall") → Recipe:
Turn 2: move(diorite → crafting_grid)
Turn 3: craft → Task complete

6 diorite in 2x3

In contrast, centralized multi-agent systems decompose inherently sequential tasks into artificial
subtasks:

Agent 1:
Agent 2:
Agent 3:

Research recipe (redundant—lookup is instantaneous)
Check inventory (redundant—state visible to all)
Execute crafting (the only necessary step)

This unnecessary decomposition generates substantial coordination messages on average for tasks
requiring only a few execution steps, consuming token budget on coordination rather than reasoning.
Conversely, Finance Agent trajectories demonstrate when coordination provides genuine value. Single-
agent execution exhibits sequential bottlenecks:

Turn 1: web_search("merger news") → Surface results
Turn 2: edgar_search("filings") → Limited depth
Turn 3–7:

Sequential exploration with insufficient breadth

Centralized coordination enables parallel information synthesis:

Orchestrator: Synthesize multi-source findings

The task’s natural decomposability such as revenue, cost, and market factors can be analyzed in-
dependently which aligns with the coordination structure, yielding +80.9% improvement. These
trajectory patterns reveal the mechanistic basis for domain-dependence: coordination overhead
becomes counterproductive when coordination complexity exceeds task complexity (PlanCraft), but
provides substantial gains when tasks naturally decompose into parallel information streams (Finance
Agent).

Aggregating across all benchmarks and architectures, the overall mean MAS improvement is
−3.5% (95% CI: [−18.6%, +25.7%]), reflecting substantial performance heterogeneity with high
variance (𝜎 = 45.2%). The performance range across MAS variants spans from −70.0% (PlanCraft
Independent) to +80.9% (Finance Centralized), indicating that MAS do not provide universal benefits
but rather domain-specific trade-offs.

Domain Complexity Moderates Coordination Efficacy. Mixed-effects regression confirms domain
complexity (refer to Appendix C for more details) as a significant negative moderator of MAS
advantage ( ˆ𝛽 = −0.114, 95% CI: [−0.186, −0.042], 𝑝 = 0.002). The mechanism operates through
fixed computational budgets (matched total tokens across MAS and SAS): in structured, decomposable
domains (Finance Agent, moderate Workbench instances), agents complete local reasoning with
residual capacity available for inter-agent communication. Here, inter-agent messages reduce variance
through redundancy elimination and enable synthesis of partial solutions, producing large performance
deltas (Finance: +80.9%). Conversely, in high-complexity sequential domains (PlanCraft), intra-
agent reasoning for constraint verification and state tracking consumes most available tokens before
communication can occur; subsequent inter-agent messages then compress reasoning quality and
produce strong negative returns (PlanCraft: −39.0% to −70.0%).

This trade-off is directly quantified by benchmark complexity, operationalized as the average
number of sequential reasoning steps required for task completion (normalized to [0, 1]). We define a
reasoning step as a single environment interaction. Tool call, state query, or action execution and count
steps as the median number of interactions required by the best-performing SAS configuration to
reach task completion across all instances in each benchmark: Workbench (0.000, minimal sequential
constraints) and Finance Agent (0.407, moderate decomposability) show positive MAS returns
or minimal overhead, while PlanCraft (0.419, high sequential dependencies) and BrowseComp-
Plus (0.839, dynamic state evolution) show degradation or minimal gains. Domain complexity
alone does not fully predict MAS effectiveness. While low-complexity domains (Workbench, D =
0.00) show modest gains and high-complexity domains (BrowseComp-Plus, D = 0.84) show limited
benefits, the critical factor is task decomposability: Finance Agent (D = 0.41) achieves +80.9%
gains through parallelizable subtask structure, whereas PlanCraft (D = 0.42) degrades by -70% due
to strict sequential dependencies despite similar complexity scores. This suggests that sequential
interdependence, rather than complexity alone, determines coordination viability. Information gain
ΔI correlates with this pattern: Finance Agent (structured domain) exhibits strong information-value
convergence (𝑟 = 0.71, 𝑝 < 0.001), while PlanCraft (sequential constraints) shows weak correlation
(𝑟 = 0.18, 𝑝 = 0.22), indicating that agents in high-complexity domains exchange limited actionable
information due to inherent sequential dependencies and state-space ambiguity.

14

Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems

Architecture-LLM Family Interactions Reveal Vendor-Specific Coordination Mechanisms. While
domain complexity broadly moderates MAS effectiveness, the architecture-domain interaction reveals
non-uniform preferences even within similar complexity regimes: no single architecture dominates
across all domains and vendors. Architecture effectiveness depends critically on domain structure:
Finance Agent benefits most from Centralized (+80.9%) and Decentralized (+74.5%), Workbench
from MAS-Decentralized (+5.6%), and BrowseComp-Plus from MAS-Decentralized (+9.2%). In
degrading domains, architecture selection becomes a least-worst optimization: PlanCraft shows
Hybrid as relatively best (-39.0%) compared to MAS-Centralized (-50.4%) and MAS-Independent
(-70.0%).

Family-specific coordination preferences emerge within improvement-positive domains. On
Finance Agent, Anthropic’s MAS-Centralized achieves +127.5% (0.636 vs. 0.280 SAS), indicating
conservative but stable coordination, whereas Google’s MAS-Centralized reaches +164.3% (0.740 vs.
0.280 SAS, averaging Centralized performance), suggesting stronger attention-mechanism alignment
with hierarchical message exchange; OpenAI’s MAS-Centralized achieves +69.9% (0.79 vs. 0.465
SAS). On Workbench, where multi-agent overhead is less tolerable (efficiency degrades from 𝐸𝑐 = 0.466
for SAS to 𝐸𝑐 = 0.074 for Hybrid, the largest relative drop across benchmarks), Anthropic’s best variant
(MAS-Decentralized, +10.8%) remains superior to Google (+9.5%) and OpenAI (+8.6%), reflecting
relative efficiency in managing coordination costs. Critically, on PlanCraft where all variants degrade,
vendor preferences flatten: Anthropic shows maximum -54.5% (MAS-Hybrid 0.31 vs. SAS 0.68),
Google shows -25.3% (best), and OpenAI shows -32.3%, indicating that communication mechanisms
cannot overcome fundamental sequential reasoning constraints. While the precise mechanisms remain
to be characterized, potential factors include differences in instruction-following fidelity, context
utilization patterns, and inter-turn consistency that affect how agents interpret and respond to coordi-
nation messages. No vendor achieves universal multi-agent dominance; instead, each exhibits relative
advantages in structured domains (Finance) that evaporate in sequential constraint-satisfaction
domains (PlanCraft), indicating that multi-agent benefits are genuinely contingent on problem
structure rather than generalizable across task types.

4.3. Scaling principles

The main results reveal substantial heterogeneity where agentic system performance ranges from
+81% improvement to −70% degradation depending on task structure and coordination architecture.
This variance correlates with measurable properties such as task decomposability, tool complexity,
and baseline difficulty. We explore a quantitative principle that not only explains this heterogeneity
but also enables prediction for unseen configurations: given measurable properties of a model, task,
and system configuration, can we predict a specific agent system’s performance?

Mixed-Effects Model Achieves 52.4% Cross-Validated Variance Explanation. We fit a scaling
principle to all 180 configurations that relates agentic system performance to four categories of
predictors: 1) base model capability (intelligence index 𝐼), 2) system configuration (agent count
𝑛𝑎), 3) task properties (tool count 𝑇, single-agent baseline 𝑃SA). These are instance-level predictors
capturing within-benchmark variation, distinct from the benchmark-level domain complexity 𝐷
defined in Appendix C, and 4) empirically measured coordination metrics from Table 5 (efficiency 𝐸𝑐,
overhead 𝑂%, error amplification 𝐴𝑒, message density 𝑐, redundancy 𝑅). Rather than including all
possible terms, we construct the model based on specific mechanistic hypotheses.

Main effects capture direct relationships between individual factors and performance. We include
a quadratic term (𝐼2) to test for non-linear capability scaling, and log-transformed tool count and
agent count following standard diminishing-returns assumptions in scaling analyses (Kaplan et al.,

15

coordination pattern differs across model families: OpenAI models show consistent gains from Cen-
tralized and Hybrid MAS configurations despite higher costs, suggesting stronger communication
synergy; Google models display marginal MAS improvements but a clear efficiency plateau, indicating
diminishing returns under lightweight coordination; and Anthropic models reveal higher variance
and occasional MAS underperformance, reflecting sensitivity to coordination overhead. These cross-
family discrepancies imply that the efficacy of multi-agent coordination is contingent on each model
family’s intrinsic communication bandwidth and reasoning alignment. Collectively, the results uncover
a family-dependent scaling law linking coordination structure, economic efficiency, and emergent
performance.

2020).

Interaction terms test specific hypotheses about how these factors combine. We include nine
interactions, each motivated by observed patterns: 𝐸𝑐 × 𝑇 tests whether efficiency penalties compound
with tool complexity; 𝐴𝑒 × 𝑇 tests whether errors propagate more severely in tool-rich environments;
𝑃SA × log(1 + 𝑛𝑎) captures the baseline paradox where high single-agent performance leaves less
room for coordination gains; 𝑂% × 𝑇 tests whether overhead costs scale with task complexity. We
deliberately exclude interactions without clear mechanistic justification (e.g., 𝑅 × 𝑐, 𝐼 × 𝑂%) to avoid
overfitting.

where all predictors are standardized (𝜇 = 0, 𝜎 = 1) for interpretability. Log transformations are
applied to right-skewed variables spanning multiple orders of magnitude (𝑂%: 0–515%; 𝑇: 4–16; 𝑛𝑎:
1–4; 𝐴𝑒: 1.0–17.2) to satisfy linearity assumptions. The 𝐴𝑒 ×𝑇 interaction retains 𝐴𝑒 without additional
log transformation because log(1+ 𝐴𝑒) already appears as a main effect; including log(1+ 𝐴𝑒) ×𝑇 would
introduce near-collinearity (VIF > 8). Sensitivity analysis confirms qualitatively identical results
under alternative specifications (Δ𝑅2
CV < 0.01). We validate model complexity through five-fold
cross-validation with experiment-level holdout, which yields 𝑅2
CV = 0.524 (±0.033 SD), mean absolute
error MAE = 0.089 (±0.011), and root mean squared error RMSE = 0.112 (±0.014). The modest gap
between training and cross-validated 𝑅2 (Δ𝑅2 = 0.076), combined with stable coefficient estimates
across folds (coefficient of variation < 18% for all | ˆ𝛽| > 0.05), indicates that the 20 parameters are
justified by predictive power rather than overfitting. This model substantially outperforms simpler
alternatives using only architectural labels (𝑅2
CV = 0.28), as shown
in Table 3. Critically, this equation contains no dataset-specific parameters, enabling prediction on
unseen task domains. Bootstrap resampling (𝑛 = 1,000 iterations) confirms coefficient stability (mean
bootstrap SE < 0.015 for all | ˆ𝛽| > 0.1), and residual diagnostics satisfy normality (Shapiro–Wilk
𝑝 = 0.412) and homoscedasticity (Breusch–Pagan 𝑝 = 0.298), with residual standard error ˆ𝜎 = 0.118.
We evaluated regularized alternatives: Lasso (10-fold CV for 𝜆 selection) retained 16 of 20 predictors
with 𝑅2
CV = 0.509. Given minimal improvement and the interpretability
benefits of the full model, we retain the unregularized specification.

CV = 0.506; Ridge achieved 𝑅2

The Efficiency-Tools Interaction Dominates Multi-Agent Performance ( ˆ𝛽 = −0.267, 𝑝 < 0.001).
Among the critical interactions, the efficiency-tools trade-off exhibits the second-largest effect size:
ˆ𝛽𝐸𝑐 ×𝑇 = −0.267 (95% CI: [−0.355, −0.178], 𝑝 < 0.001). This interaction reveals that tool-heavy tasks
suffer disproportionately from multi-agent inefficiency. Empirically, single-agent systems achieve
𝐸𝑐 = 0.466 (Table 5), while multi-agent architectures range from 𝐸𝑐 = 0.074 (hybrid) to 𝐸𝑐 = 0.234
(independent), a 2–6× efficiency penalty.

For a task with 𝑇 = 16 tools (e.g., workbench benchmark), this translates to (using raw values for

interpretability):

Δ𝑃efficiency = −0.267 × 𝐸𝑐 × 𝑇 =

(cid:40)

−1.99 (single-agent, 𝐸𝑐 = 0.466)
−0.32 (multi-agent, 𝐸𝑐 = 0.074)

Thus, single-agent systems incur minimal efficiency penalty despite lower absolute efficiency, because
the interaction magnifies the cost for architectures with many tools. Conversely, simple tasks (𝑇 ≤
4) show negligible efficiency effects (|Δ𝑃| < 0.05), explaining why multi-agent coordination can
succeed on decomposable problems. This finding contradicts the naïve hypothesis that “more agents
always help with complexity”: tool-rich environments amplify the coordination tax, making simpler
architectures paradoxically more effective. The effect size ( ˆ𝛽 = −0.267) is approximately 1.6× larger
than the third-strongest interaction, establishing efficiency management as the primary bottleneck in
agentic scaling.

Error Amplification Exhibits Architecture-Dependent Catastrophic Failure Modes. Table 5
reveals dramatic variance in error amplification factors: single-agent (𝐴𝑒 = 1.0), centralized (𝐴𝑒 =
4.4), decentralized (𝐴𝑒 = 7.8), hybrid (𝐴𝑒 = 5.1), and strikingly, independent multi-agent (𝐴𝑒 =
17.2). After controlling for other coordination metrics, neither the main effect of error amplification
( ˆ𝛽 = −0.022, 𝑝 = 0.441) nor its interaction with tool count (𝐴𝑒 × 𝑇: ˆ𝛽 = −0.019, 𝑝 = 0.506)
reaches statistical significance. This suggests that the dramatic performance differences across
architectures observed in Table 5 are better explained by other coordination mechanisms—particularly
efficiency (𝐸𝑐) and overhead (𝑂%)—rather than error propagation per se. Independent architecture’s

17

Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems

universal underperformance (mean success 0.370 vs. 0.466 SAS) stems from absence of inter-agent
communication: each agent operates in isolation, duplicating errors without correction opportunities,
but this effect is subsumed by the efficiency metric (𝐸𝑐 = 0.234 for Independent vs. 𝐸𝑐 = 0.466 for
SAS).

Overhead Scales Non-Linearly with Task Complexity via the 𝑂% × 𝑇 Interaction. Multi-agent
architectures incur substantial overhead: independent (58%), centralized (285%), decentralized
(263%), and hybrid (515%), representing 1.6–6.2× token budgets relative to single-agent at matched
performance. The scaling law reveals this overhead interacts with tool count ( ˆ𝛽𝑂%×𝑇 = −0.162,
𝑝 < 0.001), creating a compounding cost for complex tasks. For hybrid architecture (𝑂% = 515)
on workbench (𝑇 = 16), the negative interaction ( ˆ𝛽13 = −0.162, 𝑝 < 0.001) compounds overhead
costs with tool complexity, explaining hybrid’s collapse on tool-heavy benchmarks (success rate 0.452
overall, 0.21 on workbench). The functional form implies a critical threshold:

ˆ𝛽13𝑇

log(1 + 𝑂%) ≈

log(1 + 𝑂%),

𝑂%max(𝑇) =

beyond which overhead cost exceeds any coordination benefit. For 𝑇 = 16, this threshold is 𝑂% ≈
150%, ruling out all multi-agent architectures except possibly decentralized (263%, but compensated
by parallelization). Empirically, workbench confirms this prediction: decentralized (mean 0.664)
outperforms centralized (0.621) despite higher overhead, due to its superior parallel efficiency. This
overhead-complexity interaction constitutes the third-strongest effect (| 𝛽| = 0.162), reinforcing that
coordination costs are not fixed but scale super-linearly with environmental complexity.

Intelligence Shows Linear Positive Effect ( ˆ𝛽𝐼 = 0.171, 𝑝 = 0.001). After centering intelligence
scores to address multicollinearity (VIF reduced from 200 to 1.1), the linear capability effect becomes
significant: higher-capability models achieve proportionally better performance across all architectures.
The quadratic term (𝐼2) is not significant (𝑝 = 0.509), indicating that capability scaling follows a
linear rather than accelerating pattern within the tested range (𝐼 ∈ [42, 71]). This finding suggests
that coordination benefits scale consistently with model capability, without evidence of emergent
super-linear gains at higher intelligence levels.

Redundancy Provides Marginal Benefit at Scale ( ˆ𝛽𝑅×𝑛𝑎 = 0.047, 𝑝 = 0.001). Work redundancy,
defined as the fraction of subtasks performed by multiple agents ranges from 0.41 (centralized) to 0.50
(decentralized) for multi-agent systems (Table 5). The scaling law identifies a weak positive interaction
with agent count ( ˆ𝛽𝑅×𝑛𝑎 = 0.047, 95% CI: [0.019, 0.075], 𝑝 = 0.001), suggesting redundancy offers
error-correction benefits when more agents participate. For a 4-agent system with 𝑅 = 0.50:

Δ𝑃redundancy = 0.047 × 0.50 × 4 = 0.094,

equivalent to an ≈ 8% performance boost (in standardized units). However, this effect is minor
compared to overhead penalties (| ˆ𝛽𝑂%×𝑇 | = 0.162, 3.4× larger) and efficiency losses (| ˆ𝛽𝐸𝑐 ×𝑇 | =
0.267, 5.7× larger), indicating redundancy cannot compensate for architectural inefficiency. The
significance (𝑝 = 0.001, near the 𝛼 = 0.05 threshold) suggests this relationship may be context-
dependent, potentially stronger in error-prone domains or weaker when communication is expensive.
Decentralized architecture, which exhibits highest redundancy (𝑅 = 0.50 ± 0.06), achieves top
performance on tool-heavy tasks (workbench success 0.664), consistent with redundancy’s protective
role. Yet this same architecture underperforms on planning tasks (0.282), where redundancy becomes
wasteful duplication. This context-dependence aligns with the baseline paradox: redundancy helps
when there is room for improvement (𝑃SA < 0.45) but becomes overhead when baseline is high.

superior model fit even after penalizing for additional parameters.

The Scaling Principle Enables Quantitative Architecture Selection. Equation 1 synthesizes 20
parameters into a predictive tool for architecture design. Given task characteristics (𝑇, 𝑃SA) and
model capability (𝐼), practitioners can compute expected performance for each architecture using
empirical coordination metrics from Table 5. Consider three task archetypes: (1) Planning tasks
(𝑇 = 4, 𝑃SA = 0.57) favor single-agent due to baseline paradox and low tool count; (2) Analysis tasks
(𝑇 = 5, 𝑃SA = 0.35) favor centralized multi-agent, balancing error control (𝐴𝑒 = 4.4) with manageable
overhead; (3) Tool-heavy tasks (𝑇 = 16, 𝑃SA = 0.63) favor decentralized multi-agent despite high
overhead (263%), because parallelization and redundancy outweigh efficiency losses. Quantitatively,
the decision boundary between single-agent and multi-agent is:

= 0.129 (in standardized units),

corresponding to raw performance ≈ 0.45 after denormalization. This threshold, derived purely
from data, aligns with empirical best practices and offers the first quantitative criterion for coordi-
nation structure selection, replacing heuristic “when to use agents”, and “which agentic architecture
to use” guidance with a predictive model. Cross-validation on held-out configurations confirms this
rule achieves 87% correct architecture selection, substantially exceeding random choice (20%) or
capability-only models (54%). The scaling principle thus constitutes both a scientific contribution–the
first universal equation for agentic systems–and an engineering tool for resource-efficient deployment.

4.4. Coordination Efficiency, Error Dynamics, and Information Transfer

Following the Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy (MAST) proposed by Cemri et al. (2025), we cat-
egorize observed errors into specification, inter-agent misalignment, and verification failures. Building
on this taxonomy, we quantitatively analyze error frequency and propagation across architectures.

We systematically characterized coordination efficiency, error propagation mechanisms, and
information transfer across all 180 experiments. All MAS and SAS configurations were matched for
total reasoning-token budget (mean 4,800 tokens per trial) and tool-call access to isolate coordination
effects.

Turn count follows power-law scaling with number of agents. Total reasoning turns (reasoning–
response exchanges) exhibit power-law growth with agent count:

𝑇 = 2.72 × (𝑛 + 0.5)1.724,

𝑅2 = 0.974,

This relationship is fit across architecture-aggregated means; within-architecture variance remains
substantial (e.g., at n = 3: Independent averages 11.4 turns vs. Decentralized 26.1 turns), reflect-
ing topology-dependent communication patterns. This super-linear exponent (1.724 > 1) reflects
quadratic message complexity (all-to-all potential communication) tempered by practical bandwidth
limits, creating a distinct agentic scaling regime fundamentally different from neural network param-
eter scaling (e.g., Kaplan et al. report 𝑏 = 0.76 for dense models). Empirically, Hybrid systems require
6.2× more turns than SAS (44.3 vs. 7.2 turns; 𝑡(178) = 16.8, 𝑝 < 0.001), while Centralized requires

20

Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems

3.8× (27.7 turns), and Decentralized requires 3.6× (26.1 turns). The implication is stark: under fixed
computational budgets, per-agent reasoning capacity becomes prohibitively thin beyond 3–4 agents,
creating a hard resource ceiling where communication cost dominates reasoning capability.

Message Density Exhibits Logarithmic Saturation with Performance. Success rate follows a
logarithmic relationship with message density across all architectures:

𝑆 = 0.73 + 0.28 ln(𝑐),

𝑅2 = 0.68,

𝑝 < 0.001,

where 𝑐 is messages per reasoning turn. Performance plateaus near 𝑐∗ = 0.39 messages/turn (achieved
by Decentralized and Centralized architectures at 0.41 and 0.39 respectively), corresponding to
the success rates of 47.7% and 46.3%. Beyond this point, additional messages yield diminishing
returns: Hybrid systems (515% coordination overhead, 𝑇 = 44.3) shows -2.4% versus Centralized
(285% overhead, 𝑇 = 27.7), a difference of 1.1% that is not statistically significant (𝑡(178) = 0.61,
𝑝 = 0.542). This saturation reflects fundamental information limits in open-ended reasoning rather
than mechanism failures: high-performing runs show convergent token overlap (shared tokens: mean
≈ 1.8 bits; 𝑝 < 0.001 vs. low performers) suggesting message consensus is reached; further messages
add redundancy rather than novel information.

Error absorption mechanisms. We formalize error absorption as Absorb = (𝐸SAS − 𝐸MAS)/𝐸SAS,
where 𝐸 is factual error rate. The absorption mechanism operates through iterative verification: in
Centralized and Hybrid architectures, sub-agent outputs pass through an orchestrator that cross-
checks reasoning steps before aggregation, enabling detection and correction of logical inconsistencies.
In Decentralized architectures, peer debate rounds provide similar verification through explicit
challenge-response exchanges. These architectures achieve 22.7% average error reduction (95% CI:
[20.1%, 25.3%]), peaking at 31.4% for Finance Agent where structured numerical outputs facilitate
verification. Independent MAS shows no error correction (+4.6% amplification) due to absence of
any inter-agent verification mechanism where errors made by individual agents propagate directly to
the aggregated output without opportunity for correction.

The correction mechanism is revealed through token-overlap analysis. Each token in agent
rationales is labeled as: (i) unique (appears in exactly one agent); (ii) shared (two or more agents); (iii)
contradictory (semantic opposition, BERTScore < 0.3). High-performing runs exhibit: (i) increased
shared-token entropy (mean ≈ 1.8 bits for Finance Agent; 𝑝 < 0.001 vs. low-performing runs); (ii)
dramatically reduced contradictory mass (median 2.3% in successes vs. 8.1% in failures), evidence
that messages converge toward mutually consistent sub-proofs rather than self-reinforcing errors.
Interestingly, high redundancy (𝑅 > 0.50) correlates negatively with success (𝑟 = −0.136, 𝑝 = 0.004),
implying an emergent diversity-efficiency trade-off: collective capability peaks when message overlap
balances shared grounding with informational diversity; optimal redundancy occurs at 𝑅 ≈ 0.41
(Centralized median), balancing information fusion with reasoning independence.

Error Taxonomy Reveals Architecture-specific Failure Modes. We identified four error categories
as follows.

(1) Logical Contradiction: agent asserts both “X is true” and “X is false” about the same entity, or
derives conclusions violating its stated premises; (2) Numerical Drift: accumulated computational
error from cascading rounding or unit conversion mistakes, measured as relative deviation from
ground truth exceeding 5%; (3) Context Omission: failure to reference previously established entities,
relationships, or state information required for the current reasoning step; (4) Coordination Failure

of centralized (Orchestrator-Subagents) and decentralized (Peer Debate with Voting) multi-agent
architectures on BrowseComp-Plus benchmark across three LLM families. High-capability models
include GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini-2.5 Pro; low-capability models include GPT-5 nano,
Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Gemini-2.0 Flash. (1) Anthropic models uniquely benefit from heterogeneous
mixing in centralized architecture, where low-capability orchestrator with high-capability subagents
(0.42) outperforms homogeneous high-capability (0.32) by 31%, while OpenAI and Gemini show
performance degradation under heterogeneous centralized configurations. (2) Decentralized mixed-
capability approaches achieve near-optimal or superior performance compared to homogeneous high-
capability baselines (OpenAI: 0.53 vs 0.50; Anthropic: 0.47 vs 0.37; Gemini: 0.42 vs 0.43), suggesting
effective emergent collaboration despite capability asymmetry. (3) In centralized architectures,
configurations with high-capability sub-agents outperform those with high-capability orchestrators
across all model families, suggesting sub-agent capability matters more than orchestrator capability.

(MAS-specific): message misinterpretation, task allocation conflicts, or state synchronization errors
between agents. Architecture-specific patterns emerge across these categories:

• Logical Contradiction: Baseline 12.3–18.7%. Centralized reduces to 9.1% (36.4% reduction) via
consensus; Decentralized achieves 11.5% through peer verification; Independent unchanged at
16.8%.

• Numerical Drift: Baseline 20.9–24.1%. Centralized/Decentralized reduce to 18.3% (24% re-
duction) via sub-problem verification; Hybrid amplifies to 26.4% as rounding errors propagate;
Independent unchanged at 23.2%.

• Context Omission: Baseline 15.8–25.2%. Centralized reduces to 8.3% (66.8% reduction) via

orchestrator synthesis; Decentralized achieves 11.2%; Independent unchanged at 24.1%.

• Coordination Failure: Only appears in MAS. Independent: 0% (no coordination mechanism);
Centralized: 1.8%; Decentralized: 3.2%; Hybrid: 12.4% (protocol complexity exceeds robust
implementation).

These patterns identify three operational coordination regimes: (i) Under-coordination (𝑂 <
100% overhead): minimal accuracy gain (Δ𝑆 ≈ +2–4%), coordination mechanisms not yet engaged;
(ii) Optimal band (200% < 𝑂 < 300% overhead): highest success–cost ratio (𝐸𝑐 ≈ 0.16), dom-
inated by Centralized and Decentralized, with strong error absorption; (iii) Over-coordination
(𝑂 > 400% overhead): Hybrid runs with reduced efficiency (𝐸𝑐 ≈ 0.11), protocol complexity intro-
ducing coordination-failure modes. Error amplification analysis confirms: Independent architectures

Gemini-2.0 Flash (a) and Gemini-2.5 Pro (b) across multi-agent architectures with varying number of

patterns diverge notably: Gemini-2.0 Flash exhibits a clear optimum at 7 agents before degradation,
while Gemini-2.5 Pro’s decentralized architecture peaks earlier despite its higher single-agent baseline.
The centralized architecture demonstrates more stable scaling for Flash but shows diminishing returns
for Pro beyond 5 agents. Dashed lines indicate single-agent baseline performance. Results suggest
that the optimal number of agents depends on both model capacity and coordination strategy, with
coordination overhead eventually outweighing parallelization benefits.

ized contains to 4.4× ([3.8, 5.0]) through supervised aggregation.

Information Gain (IG) Predicts MAS benefit in Low-Complexity Domains. We compute infor-
mation gain ΔI by comparing pre-coordination and post-coordination task-uncertainty surrogates
(via Bayesian posterior variance reduction on key variables). In structured domains (Finance Agent,
Workbench), ΔI correlates strongly with MAS–SAS gap (𝑟 = 0.71, 𝑝 < 0.001), indicating that agents
successfully exchange high-value information and synthesize it into improved solutions. In Finance
Agent specifically, ΔI ranges 0.8–2.1 bits (mean 1.4) for successful trials vs. 0.2–0.6 bits (mean 0.4)
for failures.

Conversely, in open-world domains (BrowseComp-Plus), ΔI shows weak and non-significant
power, revealing that agents’ messages provide limited validated information due to inherent world
ambiguity. This domain-dependent information-gain pattern directly maps to observed MAS benefits:
Finance Agent (+23.1%) where information exchange is high-value; BrowseComp-Plus (+6%–8%)
where world ambiguity limits verification.

Cross-Domain Generalization Validates Coordination Principles. Architectural rankings re-
mained stable across domains (Kendall 𝜏 = 0.89, coefficient of variation < 0.1 across architectures),
indicating coordination principles transcend specific task structures. Extrapolation to larger teams
(𝑛 = 6–10) via the fitted power law yields 95% prediction intervals [3.2, 6.8]× turn-count increases
(bootstrap coverage 94.2%), with high confidence in scaling behavior. Specifically, at 𝑛 = 6 agents,
predicted turns range from 12.8 to 20.1 (SAS: 7.2; Centralized would reach ≈ 85–130 turns). This
super-linear scaling confirms the hard resource ceiling: beyond 3–4 agents, per-agent reasoning
quality degrades sharply under fixed budgets.

Economic Efficiency and Family-Specific Cost-Benefit Trade-offs. Token efficiency (success per
1,000 tokens) reveals sharp trade-offs by architecture and family: SAS achieves 67.7 successes/1K
tokens; Centralized drops to 21.5 (3.1× worse); Decentralized to 23.9 (2.8× worse); Hybrid to 13.6
(5.0× worse). Absolute dollar costs per trial vary by model: OpenAI Hybrid achieves marginal cost
≈ $0.008 per 1% success gain (steep but manageable for structured tasks), while Anthropic Hybrid
reaches ≈ $0.024 per 1% gain (3× worse, reflecting Anthropic’s sensitivity to coordination overhead).
Google maintains intermediate costs ≈ $0.012 per 1% gain across architectures, suggesting more
balanced cost-benefit trade-offs.

LLM Family-specific Deployment Signatures and Model-Architecture Alignment. Cross-family
analysis reveals distinct architectural preferences. OpenAI models show strongest Hybrid synergy
on structured tasks (Finance: 52% success Hybrid vs. 39% SAS; Workbench: 56% Hybrid vs. 42%
SAS). Anthropic models display most conservative, stable Centralized performance (mean 43% across
tasks, SD = 2.3%, lowest variance). Google models exhibit robust cross-architecture efficiency
(performance range < 5% across topologies). These patterns reflect fundamental differences in
attention mechanisms, activation sparsity, and representation geometry enabling or constraining
multi-agent interaction, not superficial hyperparameter differences.

5. Limitations and Future Works

While this work provides quantitative scaling principles for agent systems across architectures and
model families, several limitations remain. (i) Our framework systematically compares canonical
coordination structures (Independent, Decentralized, Centralized, and Hybrid) with preliminary
exploration of scaling number of agents up to nine. However, our empirical findings suggest that
scaling to larger collectives may face fundamental barriers: the communication overhead we measured
grows superlinearly with agent count, and coordination efficiency degrades substantially beyond
moderate team sizes. Whether such collectives can exhibit beneficial emergent behaviors, such as
spontaneous specialization or hierarchical self-organization, or whether communication bottlenecks
dominate remains an open question that parallels phase transitions in complex adaptive systems. (ii)
While we explore capability heterogeneity by mixing models of different intelligence levels within
the same LLM family, all agents share identical base architectures differing only in scale and role
prompts. Future work should investigate teams combining fundamentally different model architec-
tures, domain-specialized fine-tuning, or complementary reasoning strategies to understand when
epistemic diversity yields robustness rather than coordination noise. (iii) Our analysis reveals that tool-
heavy environments represent a primary failure mode for multi-agent coordination, with significant
negative interactions between tool count and system efficiency. Developing specialized coordination
protocols for tool-intensive tasks, such as explicit tool-access scheduling, capability-aware task routing,
or hierarchical tool delegation, represents an important direction for improving multi-agent reliability.
(iv) While we controlled prompts to be identical across conditions for experimental validity, we did not
optimize prompts specifically for each model or model family. Given known sensitivity of LLM behavior
to prompt formulation, architecture-specific prompt tuning may yield different scaling characteristics
than those reported here. (v) Our analysis spans four agentic benchmarks, which, while diverse in
task structure (deterministic tool use, quantitative reasoning, sequential planning, dynamic web navi-
gation), may not capture the full spectrum of agentic task characteristics. The strong differentiation
in MAS effectiveness across these four benchmarks (Figure 2) suggests that additional environments,
particularly those with intermediate characteristics or novel task structures such as embodied agents,
multi-user interaction, or long-horizon temporal dependencies would strengthen confidence in the
identified thresholds and scaling principles. (vi) The economic viability of multi-agent scaling remains

24

Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems

a practical barrier. As shown in our cost analysis (Section 4.4), token consumption and latency
grow substantially with agent count, often without proportional performance gains. Future work
should explore efficiency-oriented designs, such as sparse communication, early-exit mechanisms,
or distilled coordinator models, to make multi-agent deployments economically feasible at scale.
Additionally, current agentic benchmarks capture dynamic text-based environments but do not yet
include long-horizon temporal dependencies or real-world feedback loops. Integrating embodied
or multimodal settings (e.g., robotic control, medical triage, multi-user social interaction) will test
whether our observed scaling principles generalize beyond symbolic domains.

6. Conclusion

This study quantifies scaling principles for agentic systems across 180 controlled experiments span-
ning three LLM families and four agentic benchmarks. We reveal that multi-agent performance
is governed by quantifiable trade-offs: a tool-coordination trade-off where tool-heavy tasks suffer
from coordination overhead, capability saturation where coordination yields diminishing returns
beyond ∼45% single-agent baselines, and architecture-dependent error amplification ranging from
4.4× (centralized) to 17.2× (independent). Performance gains vary dramatically by task structure,
from +80.9% on Finance Agent to −70.0% on PlanCraft, demonstrating that coordination benefits
depend on task decomposability rather than team size. We derive a predictive model (𝑅2=0.524) that
achieves 87% accuracy in selecting optimal architectures for held-out configurations. Out-of-sample
validation on GPT-5.2, released after our study, confirms that four of five scaling principles generalize
with MAE=0.071. These results provide practitioners with quantitative guidance for architecture
selection based on measurable task properties.

Appendix

A. Model Intelligence Index

To quantify the capabilities of LLMs used in our study, we adopt while extending the Artificial Analysis
Intelligence Index3. This index provides one of the most comprehensive publicly available syntheses
of model capabilities, combining performance across reasoning, knowledge, mathematics, coding,
instruction following, long-context reasoning, and agentic workflow tasks. Its construction integrates
eight evaluation suites (e.g., MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024b), GPQA Diamond (Rein et al., 2024),
HLE (Phan et al., 2025), AIME 2025, SciCode (Tian et al., 2024), LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2025),
IFBench (Pyatkin et al., 2025), AA-LCR (Artificial Analysis Team, 2025), Terminal-Bench Hard, and
𝜏2-Bench Telecom (Barres et al., 2025)), with careful standardization, robust answer extraction, and
model-agnostic prompting.

Our study requires a unified, quantitative measure of a model’s baseline capabilities that is
independent of any agentic mechanism or multi-agent collaboration structure. The Intelligence Index
meets this requirement by: (i) evaluating all models under consistent, zero-shot, instruction-prompted
conditions; (ii) employing pass@1 scoring and robust equality-checker mechanisms; (iii) reporting
a composite measure reflecting general-purpose reasoning and problem-solving ability; and (iv)
demonstrating high statistical reliability (reported confidence interval below ±1%). This makes it
suitable as a foundational axis for studying how agentic performance scales with underlying model
capacity.

Beyond Artificial Analysis Evaluations. Artificial Analysis reports Intelligence Index scores for a
growing but still limited subset of frontier models. Our work requires a broader coverage, including
several models that are not yet benchmarked on the official platform. For these models, we inde-
pendently reproduced a subset of the Intelligence Index evaluations, specifically AA-LCR (Artificial
Analysis Team, 2025), HLE (Phan et al., 2025), MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024b), GPQA Diamond
(Rein et al., 2024), AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2025), SciCode (Tian et al., 2024), and
IFBench (Pyatkin et al., 2025) using the publicly disclosed methodology, prompts, scoring procedures,
and evaluation environments described by Artificial Analysis.

For the models without publicly available results, we computed a reconstructed Intelligence Index
following the equal-weighting formulation used in Intelligence Index v3.0.
In cases where full
reproduction was infeasible (e.g., specific agentic workflow tasks or unavailable context window
limits), we report approximate estimates (denoted with *) and discuss their limitations transparently.
These reconstructed values should be interpreted as methodologically consistent but not officially
certified estimates.

Table 6 summarizes the reconstructed Intelligence Index and underlying component scores for all
models used in our study. The table includes: (i) official Intelligence Index values when available; (ii)
reconstructed values for non-reported models; (iii) all constituent evaluation scores used to compute
the aggregate index; (iv) additional model metadata (context window, cost, throughput, latency)
relevant for agentic performance analysis.

Our reconstructed Intelligence Index values should be interpreted with appropriate caution. First,
several evaluations, particularly long-context and agentic workflow tasks, contain nondeterministic
components that may vary slightly across implementations. Second, for models without public API
support for large-context evaluation (e.g., “non-reasoning” checkpoints), our long-context estimates

represent upper-bound approximations based on available context windows and internal model
behavior. Third, Artificial Analysis maintains private test variants and additional filtering procedures
that cannot be fully reproduced. Thus, our estimates provide a methodologically aligned but not
officially verified extension.

B. Out-of-Sample Validation

To assess the generalizability of our scaling equation beyond the training distribution, we evaluate
on GPT-5.2 (Intelligence Index = 75), released after our experimental campaign. This represents
extrapolation: our training data spans Index 42–71, while GPT-5.2 exceeds this range by 4% (5.6%
beyond maximum).

Table 7 summarizes validation metrics. The scaling equation achieves MAE = 0.071, meeting
our < 0.10 threshold for practical utility. Critically, four of five qualitative findings from Section 4
generalize to this higher-capability regime (Table 8): the capability ceiling effect persists (𝑃𝑆𝐴 = 0.45,
best MAS gain = +6.7%, consistent with diminishing returns at high baselines), Independent MAS
exhibits predicted degradation (-22.2%), and Centralized/Decentralized architectures achieve optimal
performance. The partial validation concerns the Decentralized > Centralized pattern: while the
main results show a clear Decentralized advantage over SAS (+9.2% vs. +0.2%), GPT-5.2 shows
convergence (both at 0.48), suggesting that architecture-specific advantages may decrease as the
model capability increases.

Architecture-wise analysis (Table 9) reveals that MAS predictions are well-calibrated (average error
= 7.4%), while SAS shows systematic over-prediction (+49.5%). This bias does not stem from the
quadratic intelligence term, which is not significant after centering ( ˆ𝛽𝐼2 = 0.007, 𝑝 = 0.509). Instead,

the over-prediction likely reflects limitations in linear extrapolation of the capability effect ( ˆ𝛽𝐼 = 0.171)
beyond the training range (Index 42–71 to 75), where diminishing returns may emerge that are not
captured by the current functional form. Future work should explore saturation functions or piecewise-
linear specifications for extreme capability levels. These results validate our core contribution: the
scaling equation captures architectural trade-offs that generalize across capability levels, even when
absolute calibration requires refinement for extrapolation.

Architecture Selection Accuracy. We note an important caveat regarding architecture selection
when the model is at at extreme capability level. The scaling equation predicts SAS as optimal for
GPT-5.2 ( ˆ𝑃SAS = 0.673), yet empirically MAS-Centralized and MAS-Decentralized achieve superior
performance (0.48 vs. 0.45). This discrepancy does not arise from the quadratic intelligence term,
which is not significant after mean-centering ( ˆ𝛽𝐼2 = 0.007, 𝑝 = 0.509). Rather, the over-prediction
reflects the linear intelligence effect ( ˆ𝛽𝐼 = 0.171) extrapolating beyond its training range, potentially
encountering diminishing returns at higher capability levels not captured by the current specification.
The 87% architecture selection accuracy reported in Subsection 4.3 applies within the training
range (Intelligence Index 42–71); extrapolation to Index 75 reduces this to 0% for SAS prediction
but maintains 75% accuracy for MAS architecture ranking (3/4 correct: Decentralized, Hybrid,
Independent). This suggests that while absolute performance predictions require recalibration for
frontier models, relative MAS architecture rankings remain reliable.

C. Domain Complexity

We quantify domain complexity through a composite metric that captures empirical difficulty across
evaluated benchmarks. This principled approach enables systematic analysis of when multi-agent
coordination yields performance benefits versus incurring prohibitive overhead.

• Performance Ceiling. Defined as 1 − 𝑝max, where 𝑝max is the highest performance achieved by any

evaluated system. Lower ceilings indicate greater inherent task difficulty.

• Coefficient of Variation. Computed as 𝜎/𝜇, where 𝜎 and 𝜇 denote the standard deviation and mean
of performance across all configurations. This scale-invariant measure captures relative variability
independent of absolute performance ranges.

• Best-Model Baseline. Defined as 1 − 𝑝best, where 𝑝best is the state-of-the-art single-model perfor-

mance on each dataset, providing an upper bound on achievable accuracy.

The final complexity score is the arithmetic mean of these three components, yielding a robust

estimate that mitigates sensitivity to any single measure.

C.3. Critical Threshold

Our analysis identifies a critical complexity threshold at 𝐷 ≈ 0.40. Below this threshold, multi-agent
architectures yield net positive returns through effective task decomposition and parallel reasoning.
Above this threshold, coordination overhead consumes computational resources otherwise allocated
to reasoning, resulting in performance degradation. This finding suggests that the suitability of
multi-agent approaches is fundamentally constrained by domain-intrinsic properties rather than
architectural sophistication alone.

D. Datasets

We evaluate our agent systems across four agentic benchmarks requiring multi-step reasoning and
tool interaction. Each dataset emphasizes different aspects of agentic behavior: information retrieval,
domain expertise, planning, and task decomposition.

Finance Agent. We use the Finance Agent benchmark (Bigeard et al., 2025), comprising 50 finance
questions requiring domain expertise and multi-step analysis. Tasks include earnings analysis, financial
metric calculations, and market trend interpretation. Each instance includes expert-provided rubrics
for structured evaluation. Questions typically require 15-30 minutes of expert time, indicating
substantial complexity.

BrowseComp Plus. BrowseComp Plus (Chen et al., 2025) contains 100 web browsing tasks re-
quiring multi-website information synthesis. Tasks include comparative analysis, fact verification,
and comprehensive research across multiple web sources. Each instance requires agents to navigate
complex information landscapes, extract relevant details, and synthesize findings. The dataset uses
LLM-based evaluation comparing agent responses against ground truth answers with confidence
scoring.

WorkBench. WorkBench (Styles et al., 2024) evaluates business task automation through function
calling sequences. The dataset covers five domains: analytics, calendar management, email operations,
project management, and customer relationship management. Success requires executing correct tool
sequences to accomplish realistic business workflows. Evaluation follows outcome-centric assessment,
measuring exact match between predicted and expected function call sequences. The dataset supports
100 distinct business scenarios with tolerance for minor date variations.

Plancraft. Plancraft (Dagan et al., 2024) focuses on sequential planning in Minecraft environments.
Agents must craft target items by determining optimal action sequences using available inventory and
crafting recipes. Tasks require multi-step reasoning about dependencies, resource management, and
action ordering. The dataset uses environment-determined success metrics based on successful item
crafting within step limits. We use the plancraft-test subset containing focused planning challenges.

E. Implementation Details

E.1. Technical Infrastructure

Our implementation leverages LiteLLM4 for unified API access across model providers and LangChain5
for agent orchestration and tool integration. LiteLLM provides standardized interfaces for OpenAI,
Gemini, and Anthropic models, enabling seamless model switching and comparison. LangChain
facilitates tool binding, conversation management, and structured prompting.

API Integration. We access LLMs through provider-specific APIs: OpenAI API for GPT models
(gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano), GenAI API for Gemini models (gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-2.5-flash,
gemini-2.0-flash), and Anthropic API for Claude models (claude-4.5-sonnet, claude-4.0-sonnet, claude-
3.7-sonnet). Our implementation includes intelligent API key rotation across multiple keys per provider
to handle rate limiting and quota management. Context window management automatically truncates
conversation history when token limits are approached.

Tool Environment. Each dataset defines its tool ecosystem through environment configurations.
Tools include web search (Tavily6), code execution (Python REPL), mathematical operations, and
task completion markers. Tool definitions use LangChain’s BaseTool interface with structured input
schemas and execution methods. Tools are dynamically bound to LLM instances using function calling
capabilities when available.

E.2. Agent Configuration

Architecture Parameters. Single agents use maximum 10 iterations per instance. Independent
multi-agent systems deploy 3 agents with synthesis-only coordination. Centralized systems employ 3
sub-agents with 1 orchestrator across maximum 5 orchestration rounds, with 3 iterations per agent
per round. Decentralized systems run 3 agents through 3 debate rounds with 3 iterations per round.
Hybrid systems combine centralized orchestration with limited peer communication phases.

Heterogeneous Models. Our framework supports heterogeneous configurations where different
agent roles use different models. Orchestrators can use high-capability models (e.g., GPT-5) while sub-
agents use efficient models (e.g., Gemini-2.0 Flash). The LLMConfig class manages model assignment
with automatic LLM instance creation for each agent role. Decentralized systems can assign different
models to different workers for diversity.

E.3. Prompt Compilation System

We implement a structured prompting system supporting named templates and variable interpolation.
Prompts are defined in YAML files with base templates and role-specific extensions. The compilation
process performs template variable replacement using double-brace syntax (variable) and supports
conditional template selection based on agent type and conversation state.

Towards a Science of Scaling Agent Systems

Dataset Integration. Each dataset provides shared prompt templates containing task-specific
instructions and examples. Dataset instances contribute prompt variables including problem de-
scriptions, context, and constraints. The prompt compilation system merges agent prompts with
dataset templates, ensuring consistent instruction delivery across architectures while maintaining
task specificity.

E.4. Evaluation Methodology

Sample Sizes. We evaluate on dataset subsets balancing computational cost with statistical signifi-
cance: Finance Agent (50 instances), BrowseComp Plus (100 instances), WorkBench (100 instances),
and Plancraft (100 instances). Instance selection ensures representative coverage of task types and
difficulty levels within each benchmark.

Restrictions and Controls. All experiments use identical tool interfaces and observation struc-
tures across architectures to eliminate external feedback confounds. Context window management
applies consistent truncation policies. API rate limiting and retry mechanisms ensure fair resource
allocation. Evaluation uses frozen model weights without fine-tuning to measure architectural effects
independently of model optimization.

E.5. Information Gain Computation

Information gain ΔI quantifies the reduction in task uncertainty achieved through agent coordination.
We estimate this via Bayesian posterior variance reduction:

ΔI =

1
2

log

Var[𝑌 |spre]
Var[𝑌 |spost]

,

(2)

where 𝑌 ∈ {0, 1} is the task success indicator, spre is the agent’s state representation before coordination
(initial reasoning trace), and spost is the state after coordination (final aggregated output). Variances
are estimated via Monte Carlo sampling: we generate 𝐾 = 10 reasoning traces per state using
temperature 𝜏 = 0.7 and compute empirical variance of predicted success probabilities. For binary
outcomes, this reduces to:

Var[𝑌 |s] = ˆ𝑝(s)(1 − ˆ𝑝(s)),

(3)

where ˆ𝑝(s) is the mean predicted success probability across samples.

four benchmarks show best-performing multi-agent variants versus single-agent baselines by Intelli-
gence Index. OpenAI and Google exhibit strong cooperative scaling in structured tasks (Finance Agent:
+23.1%; Workbench: +20.8%; Cohen’s 𝑑 > 1.2). Anthropic models show diminished or negative
returns in open-ended environments (PlanCraft: −35.0% for uncoordinated variants; 𝑑 ≈ 0.35),
where independent reasoning sometimes outperforms coordination.
